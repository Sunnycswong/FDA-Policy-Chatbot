In the public in-terest, such mail should be distinctive in appearance so that it will be promptly recognized and read. The Food and Drug Administration will make such mailings in accordance with the specifications set forth in this sec-tion. Manufacturers and distributors of drugs are asked to make such mailings as prescribed by this section and not to use the distinctive envelopes for ordi-\\nnary mail. \\n(a) Use first class mail and No. 10 \\nwhite envelopes. \\n(b) The name and address of the agen-\\ncy or the drug manufacturer or dis-tributor is to appear in the upper left corner of the envelope. \\n(c) The following statements are to \\nappear in the far left third of the enve-lope front, in the type and size indi-cated, centered in a rectangular space approximately 3 inches wide and 2\\n1⁄4 \\ninches high with an approximately 3⁄8 \\ninch-wide border in the color indicated: \\n(1) When the information concerns a \\nsignificant hazard to health, the state-ment: \\nIMPORTANT \\nDRUG \\nWARNING \\nThe statement shall be in three lines, \\nall capitals, and centered. ‘‘Important’’ shall be in 36 point Gothic Bold type. ‘‘Drug’’ and ‘‘Warning’’ shall be in 36 point Gothic Condensed type. The rec-tangle’s border and the statement therein shall be red. \\n(2) When the information concerns \\nimportant changes in drug package la-beling, the statement: \\nIMPORTANT \\nPRESCRIBING \\nINFORMATION \\nThe statement shall be in three lines, \\nall capitals, and centered. ‘‘Important’’ shall be in 36 point Gothic Bold type. ‘‘Prescribing’’ and ‘‘Information’’ shall be in 36 point Gothic Condensed type.

I (4–1–22 Edition) § 200.7 \\nIMPORTANT \\nCORRECTION \\nOF DRUG \\nINFORMATION \\nThe statement shall be in four lines, all \\ncapitals, and centered. ‘‘Important’’ shall be in 36 point Gothic Bold type. ‘‘Correction,’’ ‘‘Of Drug,’’ and ‘‘Infor-mation’’ shall be in 36 point Gothic Condensed type. The rectangle’s border and the statement therein shall be brown. \\n§ 200.7 Supplying pharmacists with in-\\ndications and dosage information. \\nThere are presently no regulations \\nunder the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act that prevent a manufacturer \\nof prescription drugs from sending the pharmacist data he needs on indica-tions and dosage in exercising his im-portant professional function of check-ing against possible mistakes in a pre-scription.

Obviously, such printed matter should not be displayed to prospective purchasers to promote over-the-counter sale of prescription drugs. \\n§ 200.10 Contract facilities (including \\nconsulting laboratories) utilized as extramural facilities by pharma-ceutical manufacturers. \\n(a) Section 704(a) of the Federal \\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifi-cally authorizes inspection of con-sulting laboratories as well as any fac-tory, warehouse, or establishment in which prescription drugs are manufac-tured, processed, packed, or held. \\n(b) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion is aware that many manufacturers of pharmaceutical products utilize ex-tramural independent contract facili-ties, such as testing laboratories, con-tract packers or labelers, and custom grinders, and regards extramural facili-ties as an extension of the manufactur-er’s own facility. \\n(c) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion reserves the right to disclose to the pharmaceutical manufacturer, or to the applicant of a new drug applica-tion (NDA) or to the sponsor of an In-\\nvestigational New Drug (IND) Applica-tion, any information obtained during the inspection of an extramural facil-ity having a specific bearing on the compliance of the manufacturer’s, ap-plicant’s, or sponsor’s product with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Food and Drug Administration’s position is that by the acceptance of such contract work, the extramural fa-cility authorizes such disclosures. \\n(d) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion does not consider results of valida-tion studies of analytical and assay methods and control procedures to be trade secrets that may be withheld from the drug manufacturer by the contracted extramural facility. \\n[40 FR 13996, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 55 \\nFR 11576, Mar. 29, 1990] \\n§ 200.11 Use of octadecylamine in \\nsteam lines of drug establishments. \\nThe Food and Drug Administration \\nwill not object to the use of octadecylamine in steam lines where the steam may be used for autoclaving surgical instruments and gauze if the octadecylamine in the steam is not more than 2.4 parts per million. \\n§ 200.15 Definition of term ‘‘insulin.’’ \\nFor purposes of sections 801 and 802 of \\nthe act and this title, the term insulin \\nmeans the active principle of the pan-creas that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates in the animal body and which is of value in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

It is further evident that such preparations purport to be of such purity and quality as to be suit-able for safe use in the eye. \\n(2) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion concludes that all such prepara-tions, if they are not sterile, fall below their professed standard of purity or quality and may be unsafe. In a state-ment of policy issued on September 1, 1964, the Food and Drug Administra-tion ruled that liquid preparations of-fered or intended for ophthalmic use that are not sterile may be regarded as adulterated within the meaning of sec-tion 501(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), and, fur-ther, may be deemed misbranded with-in the meaning of section 502(j) of the act. This ruling is extended to affect all preparations for ophthalmic use. By this regulation, this ruling is applica-ble to ophthalmic preparations that are regulated as drugs. By the regula-tion in §800.10 of this chapter, this rul-ing is applicable to ophthalmic prep-arations that are regulated as medical devices. \\n(3) The containers of ophthalmic \\npreparations shall be sterile at the time of filling and closing, and the con-tainer or individual carton shall be so sealed that the contents cannot be used without destroying the seal. The pack-aging and labeling of ophthalmic prep-arations that are over-the-counter drugs shall also comply with §211.132 of this chapter on tamper-resistant pack-aging requirements. \\n(b) Liquid ophthalmic preparations \\npacked in multiple-dose containers should: \\n(1) Contain one or more suitable and \\nharmless substances that will inhibit the growth of microorganisms; or \\n(2) Be so packaged as to volume and \\ntype of container and so labeled as to duration of use and with such nec-essary warnings as to afford adequate protection and minimize the hazard of injury resulting from contamination during use. \\n(c) Eye cups, eye droppers, and other \\ndispensers intended for ophthalmic use should be sterile, and may be regarded as falling below their professed stand-ard of purity or quality if they are not sterile. These articles, which are regu-\\nlated as drugs if packaged with the drugs with which they are to be used, should be packaged so as to maintain sterility until the package is opened and be labeled, on or within the retail package, so as to afford adequate direc-tions and necessary warnings to mini-mize the hazard of injury resulting from contamination during use. \\n[40 FR 13996, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 47 \\nFR 50455, Nov. 5, 1982] \\n§ 200.51 Aqueous-based drug products \\nfor oral inhalation. \\n(a) All aqueous-based drug products \\nfor oral inhalation must be manufac-tured to be sterile. \\n(b) Manufacturers must also comply \\nwith the requirements in §211.113(b) of this chapter. \\n[65 FR 34089, May 26, 2000] \\nSubpart D [Reserved ] \\nSubpart E—Prescription Drug \\nConsumer Price Listing \\n§ 200.200 Prescription drugs; reminder \\nadvertisements and reminder label-ing to provide price information to consumers. \\n(a) Prescription drug reminder adver-\\ntisements and reminder labeling in-tended to provide price information to consumers are exempt from the re-quirements of §§201 .100 and 202.1 of this chapter if all of the following condi-tions are met: \\n(1) The only purpose of the reminder \\nadvertisement or reminder labeling is to provide consumers with information concerning the price charged for a pre-scription for a particular drug product, and the reminder advertisement or re-minder labeling contains no represen-tation or suggestion concerning the drug product’s safety, effectiveness, or indications for use. \\n(2) The reminder advertisement or re-\\nminder labeling contains the propri-etary name of the drug product, if any; the established (generic) name of the drug product, if any; the drug product’s strength if the product contains a sin-gle active ingredient or if the product contains more than one active ingre-dient and a relevant strength can be \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '3', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The statutory nature of this warning requires that the translation convey the meaning properly to avoid confusion and dilution of the purpose of the warning.

It is the view of the Food and Drug Administration that when such a situation prevails, compliance with this requirement would be met by a statement such as ‘‘See package insert for dosage information’’, where the de-\\ntailed information is contained in such insert. However, if an informative, re-alistic, recommended or usual dosage can readily be set forth on the label, it should appear thereon. \\n§ 201.56 Requirements on content and \\nformat of labeling for human pre-scription drug and biological prod-ucts. \\n(a) General requirements.

In accordance with §§314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be updated when new information becomes available that causes the la-beling to become inaccurate, false, or misleading. \\n(3) The labeling must be based when-\\never possible on data derived from human experience. No implied claims or suggestions of drug use may be made if there is inadequate evidence of safe-ty or a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions based on animal data but necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans must be identified as such and included with human data in the appropriate section of the labeling. \\n(b) Categories of prescription drugs sub-\\nject to the labeling content and format re-quirements in §§201.56(d) and 201.57.

In accordance with §§314.70 and 601.12 of this chapter, the labeling must be revised to include a warning about a clinically significant hazard as soon as there is reasonable evidence of a causal association with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been definitely established. A spe-cific warning relating to a use not pro-vided for under the ‘‘Indications and Usage’’ section may be required by FDA in accordance with sections 201(n) and 502(a) of the act if the drug is com-monly prescribed for a disease or con-dition and such usage is associated with a clinically significant risk or hazard. \\n(ii) Other special care precautions. This \\nsection must contain information re-garding any special care to be exer-cised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug (e.g., pre-cautions not required under any other specific section or subsection). \\n(iii) Monitoring: Laboratory tests. This \\nsection must identify any laboratory tests helpful in following the patient’s response or in identifying possible ad-verse reactions. If appropriate, infor-mation must be provided on such fac-tors as the range of normal and abnor-mal values expected in the particular situation and the recommended fre-quency with which tests should be per-formed before, during, and after ther-apy. \\n(iv) Interference with laboratory tests. \\nThis section must briefly note informa-tion on any known interference by the product with laboratory tests and ref-erence the section where the detailed information is presented (e.g., ‘‘Drug Interactions’’ section). \\n(7) 6 Adverse reactions. This section \\nmust describe the overall adverse reac-tion profile of the drug based on the en-tire safety database. For purposes of prescription drug labeling, an adverse reaction is an undesirable effect, rea-sonably associated with use of a drug, that may occur as part of the pharma-cological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. This definition does not include all adverse events observed during use of a drug, \\nonly those adverse events for which there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event. \\n(i) Listing of adverse reactions. This \\nsection must list the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. The list or lists must be preceded by the information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions (e.g., for clinical trials, total number ex-posed, extent and nature of exposure). \\n(ii) Categorization of adverse reactions. \\nWithin a listing, adverse reactions must be categorized by body system, by severity of the reaction, or in order of decreasing frequency, or by a com-bination of these, as appropriate. With-in a category, adverse reactions must be listed in decreasing order of fre-quency. If frequency information can-not be reliably determined, adverse re-actions must be listed in decreasing order of severity. \\n(A) Clinical trials experience. This sec-\\ntion must list the adverse reactions identified in clinical trials that oc-curred at or above a specified rate ap-propriate to the safety database. The rate of occurrence of an adverse reac-tion for the drug and comparators (e.g., placebo) must be presented, unless such data cannot be determined or presen-tation of comparator rates would be misleading. If adverse reactions that occurred below the specified rate are included, they must be included in a separate listing. If comparative rates of occurrence cannot be reliably deter-mined (e.g., adverse reactions were ob-served only in the uncontrolled trial portion of the overall safety database), adverse reactions must be grouped within specified frequency ranges as appropriate to the safety database for the drug (e.g., adverse reactions occur-ring at a rate of less than 1/100, adverse reactions occurring at a rate of less than 1/500) or descriptively identified, \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '25', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For adverse reactions with sig-nificant clinical implications, the list-ings must be supplemented with addi-tional detail about the nature, fre-quency, and severity of the adverse re-action and the relationship of the ad-verse reaction to drug dose and demo-graphic characteristics, if data are available and important. \\n(B) Postmarketing experience. This sec-\\ntion of the labeling must list the ad-verse reactions, as defined in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, that are identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials. \\n(iii) Comparisons of adverse reactions \\nbetween drugs. For drug products other \\nthan biological products, any claim comparing the drug to which the label-ing applies with other drugs in terms of frequency, severity, or character of ad-verse reactions must be based on ade-quate and well-controlled studies as de-fined in §314.126(b) of this chapter un-less this requirement is waived under §201.58 or §314.126(c) of this chapter. For biological products, any such claim must be based on substantial evidence. \\n(8) 7 Drug interactions. (i) This section \\nmust contain a description of clinically significant interactions, either ob-served or predicted, with other pre-scription or over-the-counter drugs, classes of drugs, or foods (e.g., dietary supplements, grapefruit juice), and spe-cific practical instructions for pre-venting or managing them. The mecha-nism(s) of the interaction, if known, must be briefly described. Interactions that are described in the ‘‘Contra-indications’’ or ‘‘Warnings and Pre-cautions’’ sections must be discussed in more detail under this section. Details of drug interaction pharmacokinetic studies that are included in the ‘‘Clin-ical Pharmacology’’ section that are pertinent to clinical use of the drug must not be repeated in this section. \\n(ii) This section must also contain \\npractical guidance on known inter-ference of the drug with laboratory tests. \\n(9) 8 Use in specific populations. This \\nsection must contain the following sub-sections: (i) 8.1 Pregnancy. This subsection of \\nthe labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings ‘‘Pregnancy Ex-posure Registry,’’ ‘‘Risk Summary,’’ ‘‘Clinical Considerations,’’ and ‘‘Data’’: \\n(A) Pregnancy exposure registry. If \\nthere is a scientifically acceptable pregnancy exposure registry for the drug, contact information needed to enroll in the registry or to obtain in-formation about the registry must be provided following the statement: ‘‘There is a pregnancy exposure reg-istry that monitors pregnancy out-comes in women exposed to ( name of \\ndrug) during pregnancy.’’ \\n(B) Risk summary. The Risk Summary \\nmust contain risk statement(s) based on data from all relevant sources (human, animal, and/or pharmacologic) that describe, for the drug, the risk of \\nadverse developmental outcomes ( i.e., \\nstructural abnormalities, embryo-fetal and/or infant mortality, functional im-pairment, alterations to growth). When multiple data sources are available, the statements must be presented in the following order: Human, animal, pharmacologic. The source(s) of the data must be stated. The labeling must state the percentage range of live births in the United States with a major birth defect and the percentage range of pregnancies in the United States that end in miscarriage, regard-less of drug exposure. If such informa-tion is available for the population(s) for which the drug is labeled, it must also be included. When use of a drug is contraindicated during pregnancy, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. When applicable, risk statements as described in paragraphs (c)(9)(i)(B)( 1) and ( 2) of this section \\nmust include a cross-reference to addi-tional details in the relevant portion of the ‘‘Data’’ subheading in the ‘‘Preg-nancy’’ subsection of the labeling. If data demonstrate that a drug is not systemically absorbed following a par-ticular route of administration, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: ‘‘( Name of drug ) is \\nnot absorbed systemically following (route of administration), and mater-nal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug.’’ \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00040 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '26', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

If human data indicate that there is an increased risk for a specific adverse de-velopmental outcome in infants born to women exposed to the drug during pregnancy, this risk must be quan-titatively compared to the risk for the same outcome in infants born to women who were not exposed to the drug but who have the disease or condi-tion for which the drug is indicated to be used. When risk information is not available for women with the disease or condition for which the drug is indi-cated, the risk for the specific outcome must be compared to the rate at which the outcome occurs in the general pop-ulation. The Risk Summary must state when there are no human data or when available human data do not establish the presence or absence of drug-associ-ated risk. \\n(2) Risk statement based on animal \\ndata. When animal data are available, \\nthe Risk Summary must summarize the findings in animals and based on these findings, describe, for the drug, the potential risk of any adverse devel-opmental outcome(s) in humans. This statement must include: The number and type(s) of species affected, timing of exposure, animal doses expressed in terms of human dose or exposure equivalents, and outcomes for pregnant animals and offspring. When animal studies do not meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies, the Risk Summary must so state. When there are no animal data, the Risk Summary must so state. \\n(3) Risk statement based on pharma-\\ncology. When the drug has a well-under-\\nstood mechanism of action that may result in adverse developmental out-come(s), the Risk Summary must ex-plain the mechanism of action and the potential associated risks. \\n(C) Clinical considerations. Under the \\nsubheading ‘‘Clinical Considerations,’’ the labeling must provide relevant in-formation, to the extent it is available, \\nunder the headings ‘‘Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk,’’ ‘‘Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period,’’ ‘‘Maternal adverse reactions,’’ ‘‘Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions,’’ and ‘‘Labor or de-livery’’: \\n(1) Disease-associated maternal and/or \\nembryo/fetal risk. If there is a serious \\nknown or potential risk to the preg-nant woman and/or the embryo/fetus associated with the disease or condi-tion for which the drug is indicated to be used, the labeling must describe the risk. \\n(2) Dose adjustments during pregnancy \\nand the postpartum period. If there are \\npharmacokinetic data that support dose adjustment(s) during pregnancy and the postpartum period, a summary of this information must be provided. \\n(3) Maternal adverse reactions. If use of \\nthe drug is associated with a maternal adverse reaction that is unique to preg-nancy or if a known adverse reaction occurs with increased frequency or se-verity in pregnant women, the labeling must describe the adverse reaction and available intervention(s) for moni-toring or mitigating the reaction. The labeling must describe, if known, the effect of dose, timing, and duration of exposure on the risk to the pregnant woman of experiencing the adverse re-action. \\n(4) Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions. If \\nit is known or anticipated that treat-ment of the pregnant woman increases or may increase the risk of an adverse reaction in the fetus or neonate, the la-beling must describe the adverse reac-tion, the potential severity and revers-ibility of the adverse reaction, and available intervention(s) for moni-toring or mitigating the reaction. The labeling must describe, if known, the effect of dose, timing, and duration of exposure on the risk. \\n(5) Labor or delivery.

This subsection of \\nthe labeling must contain the following information in the following order under the subheadings ‘‘Risk Sum-mary,’’ ‘‘Clinical Considerations,’’ and ‘‘Data’’: \\n(A) Risk summary. When relevant \\nhuman and/or animal lactation data are available, the Risk Summary must include a cross-reference to the ‘‘Data’’ subheading in the ‘‘Lactation’’ sub-section of the labeling. When human data are available, animal data must not be included unless the animal \\nmodel is specifically known to be pre-dictive for humans. When use of a drug is contraindicated during breastfeeding, this information must be stated first in the Risk Summary. \\n(1) Drug not absorbed systemically. If \\ndata demonstrate that the drug is not systemically absorbed by the mother, the Risk Summary must contain only the following statement: ‘‘( Name of \\ndrug) is not absorbed systemically by \\nthe mother following (route of admin-istration), and breastfeeding is not ex-pected to result in exposure of the child to ( name of drug ).’’ \\n(2) Drug absorbed systemically. If the \\ndrug is absorbed systemically, the Risk Summary must describe the following to the extent relevant information is available: \\n(i) Presence of drug in human milk. The \\nRisk Summary must state whether the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) are present in human milk. If there are no data to assess this, the Risk Summary must so state. If studies demonstrate that the drug and/or its active metabo-lite(s) are not detectable in human \\nmilk, the Risk Summary must state the limits of the assay used. If studies demonstrate the presence of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk, the Risk Summary must state the concentration of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) in human milk and the actual or esti-mated daily dose for an infant fed ex-clusively with human milk. The actual or estimated amount of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s) ingested by the infant must be compared to the labeled infant or pediatric dose, if available, or to the maternal dose. If studies dem-onstrate the presence of the drug and/ or its active metabolite(s) in human milk but the drug and/or its active me-tabolite(s) are not expected to be sys-temically bioavailable to the breast-fed child, the Risk Summary must describe the disposition of the drug and/or its active metabolite(s).

For \\ndrugs absorbed systemically, unless breastfeeding is contraindicated during drug therapy, the following risk and benefit statement must appear at the end of the Risk Summary: ‘‘The devel-opmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for (name of drug ) and any potential ad-\\nverse effects on the breast-fed child from ( name of drug ) or from the under-\\nlying maternal condition.’’ \\n(B) Clinical considerations. Under \\n‘‘Clinical Considerations,’’ the fol-lowing information must be provided to the extent it is available and rel-evant: \\n(1) Minimizing exposure. The labeling \\nmust describe ways to minimize expo-sure in the breast-fed child if: The drug and/or its active metabolite(s) are present in human milk in clinically relevant concentrations; the drug does not have an established safety profile in infants; and the drug is used either intermittently, in single doses, or for short courses of therapy. When applica-ble, the labeling must also describe ways to minimize a breast-fed child’s oral intake of topical drugs applied to the breast or nipple skin. \\n(2) Monitoring for adverse reactions. \\nThe labeling must describe available intervention(s) for monitoring or miti-gating the adverse reaction(s) pre-sented in the Risk Summary. \\n(C) Data. Under the subheading \\n‘‘Data,’’ the labeling must describe the data that are the basis for the Risk \\nSummary and Clinical Considerations. \\n(iii) 8.3 Females and males of reproduc-\\ntive potential. When pregnancy testing \\nand/or contraception are required or recommended before, during, or after drug therapy and/or when there are human and/or animal data that suggest drug-associated fertility effects, this subsection of labeling must contain this information under the subheadings ‘‘Pregnancy Testing,’’ ‘‘Contracep-tion,’’ and ‘‘Infertility,’’ in that order. \\n(iv) 8.4 Pediatric use. (A) Pediatric \\npopulation(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (c)(9)(iv)(B) through (c)(9)(iv)(H) of this section, the terms pediatric population(s) and pedi-\\natric patient(s) are defined as the pedi-\\natric age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neo-nates, infants, children, and adoles-cents. \\n(B) If there is a specific pediatric in-\\ndication different from those approved for adults that is supported by ade-quate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, it must be de-scribed under the ‘‘Indications and Usage’’ section, and appropriate pedi-atric dosage information must be given under the ‘‘Dosage and Administra-tion’’ section. The ‘‘Pediatric use’’ sub-section must cite any limitations on the pediatric indication, need for spe-cific monitoring, specific hazards asso-ciated with use of the drug in any sub-sets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pedi-atric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this sub-section should be discussed in more de-tail, if appropriate, under the ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ or ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ section. As appropriate, this informa-tion must also be contained in the ‘‘Contraindications’’ and/or ‘‘Warnings and Precautions’’ section(s). \\n(C) If there are specific statements on \\npediatric use of the drug for an indica-tion also approved for adults that are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they must be summarized in the ‘‘Pe-diatric use’’ subsection and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00043 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '29', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For example, pediatric pharmaco-kinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and dose response information should be described in the ‘‘Clinical Pharma-cology’’ section. Pediatric dosing in-structions must be included in the ‘‘Dosage and Administration’’ section. Any differences between pediatric and adult responses, need for specific moni-toring, dosing adjustments, and any other information related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients must be cited briefly in the ‘‘Pediatric use’’ subsection and, as ap-\\npropriate, in the ‘‘Contraindications,’’ ‘‘Warnings and Precautions,’’ and ‘‘Dosage and Administration’’ sections. (E) If the requirements for a finding \\nof substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for a par-ticular pediatric population, the ‘‘Pe-diatric use’’ subsection must contain an appropriate statement such as ‘‘Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of ( ll) have \\nnot been established.’’ If use of the drug in this pediatric population is as-sociated with a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in this sub-section, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ‘‘Contraindica-tions’’ or ‘‘Warnings and Precautions’’ section and this subsection must refer to it. \\n(F) If the requirements for a finding \\nof substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection must contain the following statement: ‘‘Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.’’ If use of the drug in premature or neo-natal infants, or other pediatric sub-groups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard must be described in this subsection, or, if appropriate, the hazard must be stated in the ‘‘Contra-indications’’ or ‘‘Warnings and Pre-cautions’’ section and this subsection must refer to it. \\n(G) If the sponsor believes that none \\nof the statements described in para-graphs (c)(9)(iv)(B) through (c)(9)(iv)(F) of this section are appropriate or rel-evant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s).

(A) A specific \\ngeriatric indication, if any, that is sup-ported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population must be described under the ‘‘Indica-tions and Usage’’ section, and appro-priate geriatric dosage must be stated under the ‘‘Dosage and Administra-tion’’ section. The ‘‘Geriatric use’’ sub-section must cite any limitations on the geriatric indication, need for spe-cific monitoring, specific hazards asso-ciated with the geriatric indication, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, information contained in the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection must per-tain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summa-rized in this subsection must be dis-cussed in more detail, if appropriate, under ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ or the ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ section. As appro-priate, this information must also be contained in the ‘‘Warnings and Pre-cautions’’ and/or ‘‘Contraindications’’ section(s). \\n(B) Specific statements on geriatric \\nuse of the drug for an indication ap-proved for adults generally, as distin-guished from a specific geriatric indi-cation, must be contained in the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection and must reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appro-priate use of the drug in elderly pa-tients. This information includes de-tailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and pertinent information from well-docu-mented studies obtained from a lit-erature search. Controlled studies in-clude those that are part of the mar-keting application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug applica-tion, new drug application, biologics li-cense application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applica-tions (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection must con-tain the following statement(s) or rea-sonable alternative, as applicable, tak-ing into account available information: \\n(1) If clinical studies did not include \\nsufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly \\nsubjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection must include the following statement: \\nClinical studies of ( name of drug ) did \\nnot include sufficient numbers of sub-jects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clin-ical experience has not identified dif-ferences in responses between the el-derly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, re-flecting the greater frequency of de-creased hepatic, renal, or cardiac func-tion, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. \\n(2) If clinical studies (including stud-\\nies that are part of marketing applica-tions and other relevant studies avail-able to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor’s applica-tions) included enough elderly subjects to make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in \\nsafety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection must con-tain the following statement: \\nOf the total number of subjects in clinical \\nstudies of ( name of drug ), ll percent were 65 \\nand over, while ll percent were 75 and over. \\n(Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the studies who were 65 and over and 75 and over.) No overall differences in safety or ef-fectiveness were observed between these sub-jects and younger subjects, and other re-ported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. \\n(3) If evidence from clinical studies \\nand other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific moni-toring or dosage adjustment, the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00045 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '31', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The principal display panel shall be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and conspicuousness and with-out obscuring designs, vignettes, or crowding. Where packages bear alter-nate principal display panels, informa-tion required to be placed on the prin-cipal display panel shall be duplicated on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform type size in declaring the quantity of con-tents for all packages of substantially the same size, the term area of the prin-\\ncipal display panel means the area of \\nthe side or surface that bears the prin-cipal display panel, which area shall be: \\n(a) In the case of a rectangular pack-\\nage where one entire side properly can be considered to be the principal dis-play panel side, the product of the height times the width of that side; \\n(b) In the case of a cylindrical or \\nnearly cylindrical container, 40 percent \\nof the product of the height of the con-tainer times the circumference; and \\n(c) In the case of any other shape of \\ncontainer, 40 percent of the total sur-face of the container: Provided, how-\\never, That where such container pre-\\nsents an obvious ‘‘principal display panel’’ such as the top of a triangular or circular package, the area shall con-sist of the entire top surface. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '36', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In the case of an over-the- counter drug that is a mixture and that has no established name, this require-ment shall be deemed to be satisfied by a prominent and conspicuous state-ment of the general pharmacological action(s) of the mixture or of its prin-cipal intended action(s) in terms that are meaningful to the layman. Such statements shall be placed in direct conjunction with the most prominent display of the proprietary name or des-ignation and shall employ terms de-scriptive of general pharmacological category(ies) or principal intended ac-tion(s); for example, ‘‘antacid,’’ ‘‘an-algesic,’’ ‘‘decongestant,’’ ‘‘antihis-taminic,’’ etc. The indications for use shall be included in the directions for use of the drug, as required by section 502(f)(1) of the act and by the regula-tions in this part. \\n(c) The statement of identity shall be \\npresented in bold face type on the prin-cipal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to the most promi-nent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed. § 201.62 Declaration of net quantity of \\ncontents. \\n(a) The label of an over-the-counter \\ndrug in package form shall bear a dec-laration of the net quantity of con-tents. This shall be expressed in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination or numerical count and weight, measure, or size. The statement of quantity of drugs in tab-let, capsule, ampule, or other unit form and the quantity of devices shall be ex-pressed in terms of numerical count; the statement of quantity for drugs in other dosage forms shall be in terms of weight if the drug is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or in terms of fluid measure if the drug is liquid. The drug quantity statement shall be augmented when necessary to give accurate information as to the strength of such drug in the package; for example, to differentiate between several strengths of the same drug ‘‘100 tablets, 5 grains each’’ or \\n‘‘100 capsules, 125 milligrams each’’ or ‘‘100 capsules, 250 milligrams each’’: Provided, That: \\n(1) In the case of a firmly established, \\ngeneral consumer usage and trade cus-tom of declaring the quantity of a drug in terms of linear measure or measure of area, such respective term may be used.

Under this sec-\\ntion heading, the labeling shall de-scribe those situations in which the drug should not be used because the risk of use clearly outweighs any pos-sible benefit. These situations include administration of the drug to patients known to have a hypersensitivity to it; use of the drug in patients who, be-cause of their particular age, sex, con-comitant therapy, disease state, or other condition, have a substantial risk of being harmed by it; or contin-ued use of the drug in the face of an un-acceptably hazardous adverse reaction.

The labeling shall be re-vised to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an asso-ciation of a serious hazard with a drug; a causal relationship need not have been proved. A specific warning relat-ing to a use not provided for under the ‘‘Indications and Usage’’ section of the labeling may be required by the Food and Drug Administration if the drug is commonly prescribed for a disease or condition, and there is lack of substan-tial evidence of effectivenes for that disease or condition, and such usage is associated with serious risk or hazard. Special problems, particularly those that may lead to death or serious in-jury, may be required by the Food and Drug Administration to be placed in a prominently displayed box. The boxed warning ordinarily shall be based on clinical data, but serious animal tox-icity may also be the basis of a boxed warning in the absence of clinical data. If a boxed warning is required, its loca-tion will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration. The frequency of these serious adverse reactions and, if known, the approximate mortality and morbidity rates for patients sustaining the reaction, which are important to safe and effective use of the drug, shall be expressed as provided under the ‘‘Adverse Reactions’’ section of the la-beling. \\n(f) Precautions. Under this section \\nheading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections as appropriate for the drug: \\n(1) General. This subsection of the la-\\nbeling shall contain information re-garding any special care to be exer-cised by the practitioner for safe and effective use of the drug, e.g., pre-cautions not required under any other specific section or subsection of the la-beling. \\n(2) Information for patients. This sub-\\nsection must contain information nec-essary for patients to use the drug safe-ly and effectively (e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects). Any FDA-ap-proved patient labeling must be ref-erenced in this section and the full text of such patient labeling must be re-\\nprinted immediately following the last section of labeling or, alternatively, accompany the prescription drug label-ing. The type size requirement for the Medication Guide set forth in §208.20 of this chapter does not apply to the Medication Guide that is reprinted in or accompanying the prescription drug labeling unless such Medication Guide is to be detached and distributed to pa-tients in compliance with §208.24 of this chapter. \\n(3) Laboratory tests. This subsection of \\nthe labeling shall identify any labora-tory tests that may be helpful in fol-lowing the patient’s response or in identifying possible adverse reactions. If appropriate, information shall be provided on such factors as the range of normal and abnormal values ex-pected in the particular situation and the recommended frequency with which tests should be done before, dur-ing, and after therapy. \\n(4)(i) Drug interactions. This sub-\\nsection of the labeling shall contain specific practical guidance for the phy-sician on preventing clinically signifi-cant drug/drug and drug/food inter-actions that may occur in vivo in pa-tients taking the drug. Specific drugs or classes of drugs with which the drug to which the labeling applies may interact in vivo shall be identified, and the mechanism(s) of the interaction shall be briefly described. Information in this subsection of the labeling shall be limited to that pertaining to clin-ical use of the drug in patients. Drug interactions supported only by animal or in vitro experiments may not ordi-narily be included, but animal or in vitro data may be used if shown to be clinically relevant. Drug incompati-bilities, i.e., drug interactions that may occur when drugs are mixed in vitro, as in a solution for intravenous administration, shall be discussed under the ‘‘Dosage and Administra-tion’’ section of the labeling rather than under this subsection of the label-ing. \\n(ii) Drug/laboratory test interactions. \\nThis subsection of the labeling shall contain practical guidance on known interference of the drug with labora-tory tests. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00070 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '56', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='61 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 201.80 \\n(5) Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impair-\\nment of fertility. This subsection of the \\nlabeling shall state whether long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential and, if so, the species and results. If repro-duction studies or other data in ani-mals reveal a problem or potential problem concerning mutagenesis or im-pairment of fertility in either males or females, the information shall be de-scribed. Any precautionary statement on these topics shall include practical, relevant advice to the physician on the significance of these animal findings. If there is evidence from human data that the drug may be carcinogenic or muta-genic or that it impairs fertility, this information shall be included under the ‘‘Warnings’’ section of the labeling. Also, under ‘‘Precautions,’’ the label-ing shall state: ‘‘See ‘Warnings’ section for information on carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fer-tility.’’ \\n(6) Pregnancy. This subsection of the \\nlabeling may be omitted only if the drug is not absorbed systemically and the drug is not known to have a poten-tial for indirect harm to the fetus. For all other drugs, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following in-formation: \\n(i) Teratogenic effects. Under this \\nheading the labeling shall identify one of the following categories that applies to the drug, and the labeling shall bear the statement required under the cat-egory: \\n(a) If adequate and well-controlled \\nstudies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: ‘‘Studies in pregnant women have not shown that ( name of drug ) increases the \\nrisk of fetal abnormalities if adminis-tered during the first ( second, third, or \\nall) trimester( s) of pregnancy. If this \\ndrug is used during pregnancy, the pos-sibility of fetal harm appears remote. Because studies cannot rule out the possibility of harm, however, ( name of \\ndrug) should be used during pregnancy \\nonly if clearly needed.’’ The labeling shall also contain a description of the human studies. If animal reproduction studies are available and they fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, the la-\\nbeling shall also state: ‘‘Reproduction studies have been performed in ( kinds \\nof animal (s)) at doses up to ( x) times the \\nhuman dose and have revealed no evi-dence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ( name of drug ).’’ The \\nlabeling shall also contain a descrip-tion of available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, develop-ment, and functional maturation of the child. \\n(b) If animal reproduction studies \\nhave failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the labeling shall state: ‘‘ Re-production studies have been per-formed in ( kind(s) of animal (s)) at doses \\nup to ( x) times the human dose and \\nhave revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to (name of drug ). There are, however, no \\nadequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal re-production studies are not always pre-dictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only \\nif clearly needed.’’ If animal reproduc-tion studies have shown an adverse ef-fect (other than decrease in fertility), but adequate and well-controlled stud-ies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus during the first trimester of pregnancy (and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters), the labeling shall state: ‘‘Reproduction studies in ( kind(s) of \\nanimal (s)) have shown ( describe findings ) \\nat (x) times the human dose. Studies in \\npregnant women, however, have not shown that ( name of drug ) increases the \\nrisk of abnormalities when adminis-tered during the first ( second, third, or \\nall) trimester( s) of pregnancy. Despite \\nthe animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is re-mote, if the drug is used during preg-nancy. Nevertheless, because the stud-ies in humans cannot rule out the pos-sibility of harm, ( name of drug ) should \\nbe used during pregnancy only if clear-ly needed.’’ The labeling shall also con-tain a description of the human studies and a description of available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00071 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '57', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

I (4–1–22 Edition) § 201.80 \\n(c) If animal reproduction studies \\nhave shown an adverse effect on the fetus, if there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, and if the benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks, the labeling shall state: ‘‘ ( Name of drug ) has been \\nshown to be teratogenic (or to have an embryocidal effect or other adverse ef-fect) in ( name (s) of species ) when given \\nin doses ( x) times the human dose. \\nThere are no adequate and well-con-trolled studies in pregnant women. (Name of drug ) should be used during \\npregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.’’ The labeling shall contain a de-scription of the animal studies. If there are no animal reproduction studies and no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, the labeling shall state: ‘‘Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ( name of drug ). It \\nis also not known whether ( name of \\ndrug) can cause fetal harm when ad-\\nministered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. ( Name of \\ndrug) should be given to a pregnant \\nwoman only if clearly needed.’’ The la-beling shall contain a description of any available data on the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. \\n(d) If there is positive evidence of \\nhuman fetal risk based on adverse reac-tion data from investigational or mar-keting experience or studies in hu-mans, but the potential benefits from the use of the drug in pregnant women may be acceptable despite its potential risks (for example, if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or seri-ous disease for which safer drugs can-not be used or are ineffective), the la-beling shall state: ‘‘ See ‘Warnings’ sec-tion.’’ Under the ‘‘Warnings’’ section, the labeling states: ‘‘( Name of drug ) can \\ncause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( Describe the human \\ndata and any pertinent animal data. ) If \\nthis drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.’’ \\n(e) If studies in animals or humans \\nhave demonstrated fetal abnormalities or if there is positive evidence of fetal risk based on adverse reaction reports \\nfrom investigational or marketing ex-perience, or both, and the risk of the use of the drug in a pregnant woman clearly outweighs any possible benefit (for example, safer drugs or other forms of therapy are available), the la-beling shall state: ‘‘ See ‘Contraindica-tions’ section.’’ Under ‘‘Contraindica-tions,’’ the labeling shall state: ‘‘(Name \\nof drug) may ( can) cause fetal harm \\nwhen administered to a pregnant woman. ( Describe the human data and \\nany pertinant animal data. ) (Name of \\ndrug) is contraindicated in women who \\nare or may become pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be ap-prised of the potential hazard to the fetus.’’ \\n(ii) Nonteratogenic effects. Under this \\nheading the labeling shall contain other information on the drug’s effects on reproduction and the drug’s use dur-ing pregnancy that is not required spe-cifically by one of the pregnancy cat-egories, if the information is relevant to the safe and effective use of the drug. Information required under this heading shall include nonteratogenic effects in the fetus or newborn infant (for example, withdrawal symptoms or hypoglycemia) that may occur because of a pregnant woman’s chronic use of the drug for a preexisting condition or disease. \\n(7) Labor and delivery. If the drug has \\na recognized use during labor or deliv-ery (vaginal or abdominal delivery), whether or not the use is stated in the indications section of the labeling, this subsection of the labeling shall de-scribe the available information about the effect of the drug on the mother and the fetus, on the duration of labor or delivery, on the possibility that for-ceps delivery or other intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary, and the effect of the drug on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child. If any information required under this subsection is unknown, this subsection of the labeling shall state that the in-formation is unknown. \\n(8) Nursing mothers.

Pertinent adverse effects observed in animal offspring shall be described. \\n(ii) If a drug is absorbed systemically \\nand is known to be excreted in human milk, this subsection of the labeling shall contain one of the following statements, as appropriate. If the drug is associated with serious adverse reac-tions or if the drug has a known tumorigenic potential, the labeling shall state: ‘‘Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ( name of drug ) (or, ‘‘Be-\\ncause of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for ( name of \\ndrug) in ( animal or human ) studies), a \\ndecision should be made whether to \\ndiscontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the im-portance of the drug to the mother.’’ If the drug is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential, the la-beling shall state: ‘‘Caution should be exercised when ( name of drug ) is admin-\\nistered to a nursing woman.’’ \\n(iii) If a drug is absorbed system-\\nically and information on excretion in human milk is unknown, this sub-section of the labeling shall contain one of the following statements, as ap-propriate. If the drug is associated with serious adverse reactions or has a known tumorigenic potential, the la-beling shall state: ‘‘It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the po-tential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ( name of drug ) (or, \\n‘‘Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for ( name of \\ndrug) in ( animal or human ) studies), a \\ndecision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the im-portance of the drug to the mother.’’ If the drug is not associated with serious adverse reactions and does not have a known tumorigenic potential, the la-beling shall state: ‘‘It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exer-cised when ( name of drug ) is adminis-\\ntered to a nursing woman.’’ \\n(9) Pediatric use. (i) Pediatric popu-\\nlation(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(viii) of this section, the terms pediatric population(s) and pedi-\\natric patient(s) are defined as the pedi-\\natric age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neo-nates, infants, children, and adoles-cents. \\n(ii) If there is a specific pediatric in-\\ndication (i.e., an indication different from those approved for adults) that is supported by adequate and well-con-trolled studies in the pediatric popu-lation, it shall be described under the ‘‘Indications and Usage’’ section of the labeling, and appropriate pediatric dos-age information shall be given under the ‘‘Dosage and Administration’’ sec-tion of the labeling. The ‘‘Pediatric use’’ subsection shall cite any limita-tions on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific haz-ards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pe-diatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this sub-section of the labeling should be dis-cussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ or ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ section. As appro-priate, this information shall also be contained in the ‘‘Contraindications,’’ ‘‘Warnings,’’ and elsewhere in the ‘‘Precautions’’ sections. \\n(iii) If there are specific statements \\non pediatric use of the drug for an indi-cation also approved for adults that are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they shall be summarized in the ‘‘Pe-diatric use’’ subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appro-priate, under the ‘‘Clinical Pharma-cology’’ and ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ sec-tions.

I (4–1–22 Edition) § 201.80 \\nin any subsets of the pediatric popu-\\nlation (e.g., neonates), differences be-tween pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appropriate, this infor-mation shall also be contained in the ‘‘Contraindications,’’ ‘‘Warnings,’’ and elsewhere in the ‘‘Precautions’’ sec-tions. \\n(iv) FDA may approve a drug for pe-\\ndiatric use based on adequate and well- controlled studies in adults, with other information supporting pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the dis-ease and the effects of the drug, both beneficial and adverse, are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult popu-lations to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric pa-tients. The additional information sup-porting pediatric use must ordinarily include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of appropriate dos-age. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in the pediatric population, data from other studies supporting the safe-ty or effectiveness of the drug in pedi-atric patients, pertinent premarketing or postmarketing studies or experi-ence, may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and effec-tively in pediatric patients. When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults with other information sup-porting pediatric use, the ‘‘Pediatric use’’ subsection of the labeling shall contain either the following statement, or a reasonable alternative: ‘‘The safe-ty and effectiveness of ( drug name ) have \\nbeen established in the age groups l to \\nl (note any limitations, e.g., no data \\nfor pediatric patients under 2, or only applicable to certain indications ap-proved in adults). Use of ( drug name ) in \\nthese age groups is supported by evi-dence from adequate and well-con-trolled studies of ( drug name ) in adults \\nwith additional data (insert wording that accurately describes the data sub-mitted to support a finding of substan-tial evidence of effectiveness in the pe-diatric population).’’ Data summarized in the preceding prescribed statement in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appro-\\npriate, under the ‘‘Clinical Pharma-cology’’ or the ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ sec-tion. For example, pediatric pharmaco-kinetic or pharmacodynamic studies and dose-response information should be described in the ‘‘Clinical Pharma-cology’’ section. Pediatric dosing in-structions shall be included in the ‘‘Dosage and Administration’’ section of the labeling. Any differences be-tween pediatric and adult responses, need for specific monitoring, dosing ad-justments, and any other information related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients shall be cited briefly in the ‘‘Pediatric use’’ sub-section and, as appropriate, in the ‘‘Contraindications,’’ ‘‘Warnings,’’ ‘‘Precautions,’’ and ‘‘Dosage and Ad-ministration’’ sections. \\n(v) If the requirements for a finding \\nof substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for a par-ticular pediatric population, the ‘‘Pe-diatric use’’ subsection of the labeling shall contain an appropriate statement such as ‘‘Safety and effectiveness in pe-diatric patients below the age of ( l) \\nhave not been established.’’ If use of the drug in this pediatric population is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in this sub-section of the labeling, or, if appro-priate, the hazard shall be stated in the ‘‘Contraindications’’ or ‘‘Warnings’’ section of the labeling and this sub-section shall refer to it. \\n(vi) If the requirements for a finding \\nof substantial evidence to support a pe-diatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following statement: ‘‘Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been estab-lished.’’ If use of the drug in premature or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in this subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the ‘‘Contraindications’’ or ‘‘Warn-ings’’ section of the labeling and this subsection shall refer to it. \\n(vii) If the sponsor believes that none \\nof the statements described in para-graphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi) of this \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '60', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(i) A specific geri-\\natric indication, if any, that is sup-ported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the geriatric population shall be described under the ‘‘Indica-tions and Usage’’ section of the label-ing, and appropriate geriatric dosage shall be stated under the ‘‘Dosage and Administration’’ section of the label-ing. The ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection shall cite any limitations on the geri-atric indication, need for specific moni-toring, specific hazards associated with the geriatric indication, and other in-formation related to the safe and effec-tive use of the drug in the geriatric population. Unless otherwise noted, in-formation contained in the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection of the labeling shall pertain to use of the drug in persons 65 years of age and older. Data summa-rized in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if ap-propriate, under ‘‘Clinical Pharma-cology’’ or the ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ sec-tion. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in ‘‘Contra-indications,’’ ‘‘Warnings,’’ and else-where in ‘‘Precautions.’’ \\n(ii) Specific statements on geriatric \\nuse of the drug for an indication ap-proved for adults generally, as distin-guished from a specific geriatric indi-cation, shall be contained in the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection and shall reflect all information available to the sponsor that is relevant to the appro-priate use of the drug in elderly pa-tients. This information includes de-tailed results from controlled studies that are available to the sponsor and \\npertinent information from well-docu-mented studies obtained from a lit-erature search. Controlled studies in-clude those that are part of the mar-keting application and other relevant studies available to the sponsor that have not been previously submitted in the investigational new drug applica-tion, new drug application, biological license application, or a supplement or amendment to one of these applica-tions (e.g., postmarketing studies or adverse drug reaction reports). The ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection shall con-tain the following statement(s) or rea-sonable alternative, as applicable, tak-ing into account available information: \\n(A) If clinical studies did not include \\nsufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection shall include the following statement: \\n‘‘Clinical studies of (name of drug) did not \\ninclude sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they re-spond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or car-diac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.’’ \\n(B) If clinical studies (including stud-\\nies that are part of marketing applica-tions and other relevant studies avail-able to the sponsor that have not been submitted in the sponsor’s applica-tions) included enough elderly subjects \\nto make it likely that differences in safety or effectiveness between elderly and younger subjects would have been detected, but no such differences (in safety or effectiveness) were observed, and other reported clinical experience has not identified such differences, the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection shall con-tain the following statement: \\nOf the total number of subjects in clinical \\nstudies of (name of drug), l percent were 65 \\nand over, while l percent were 75 and over. \\n(Alternatively, the labeling may state the total number of subjects included in the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '61', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

No overall differences in safety or ef-fectiveness were observed between these sub-jects and younger subjects, and other re-ported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. \\n(C) If evidence from clinical studies \\nand other reported clinical experience available to the sponsor indicates that use of the drug in elderly patients is associated with differences in safety or effectiveness, or requires specific moni-toring or dosage adjustment, the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection of the label-ing shall contain a brief description of observed differences or specific moni-toring or dosage requirements and, as appropriate, shall refer to more de-tailed discussions in the ‘‘Contra-indications,’’ ‘‘Warnings,’’ ‘‘Dosage and Administration,’’ or other sections of the labeling. \\n(iii)(A) If specific pharmacokinetic or \\npharmacodynamic studies have been carried out in the elderly, they shall be described briefly in the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection of the labeling and in detail under the ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ section. The ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ section and ‘‘Drug interactions’’ sub-section of the ‘‘Precautions’’ section ordinarily contain information on drug-disease and drug-drug inter-actions that is particularly relevant to the elderly, who are more likely to have concomitant illness and to utilize concomitant drugs. \\n(B) If a drug is known to be substan-\\ntially excreted by the kidney, the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ subsection shall in-clude the statement: \\n‘‘This drug is known to be substantially ex-\\ncreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in pa-tients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have de-creased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.’’ \\n(iv) If use of the drug in the elderly \\nappears to cause a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described in the ‘‘Geri-atric use’’ subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the ‘‘Contraindications,’’ ‘‘Warnings,’’ or ‘‘Precautions’’ section of the labeling, and the ‘‘Geriatric use’’ \\nsubsection shall refer to those sections. \\n(v) Labeling under paragraphs \\n(f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(iii) of this sec-tion may include statements, if they would be useful in enhancing safe use of the drug, that reflect good clinical practice or past experience in a par-ticular situation, e.g., for a sedating drug, it could be stated that: \\n‘‘Sedating drugs may cause confusion and \\nover-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of (name of drug) and observed closely.’’ \\n(vi) If the sponsor believes that none \\nof the requirements described in para-graphs (f)(10)(i) through (f)(10)(v) of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons for omis-sion of the statements and may pro-pose an alternative statement. FDA may permit omission of the statements if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appro-priate or relevant to the drug’s label-ing. FDA may permit use of an alter-native statement if the agency deter-mines that such statement is accurate and appropriate. \\n(g) Adverse Reactions. An adverse re-\\naction is an undesirable effect, reason-ably associated with the use of the drug, that may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the drug or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. \\n(1) This section of the labeling shall \\nlist the adverse reactions that occur with the drug and with drugs in the same pharmacologically active and chemically related class, if applicable. \\n(2) In this listing, adverse reactions \\nmay be categorized by organ system, by severity of the reaction, by fre-quency, or by toxicological mecha-nism, or by a combination of these, as appropriate.

Under \\nthis section heading, the labeling shall contain the following subsections, as appropriate for the drug: \\n(1) Controlled Substance. If the drug is \\ncontrolled by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the schedule in which it is controlled shall be stated. \\n(2) Abuse. This subsection of the la-\\nbeling shall be based primarily on human data and human experience, but pertinent animal data may also be used. This subsection shall state the types of abuse that can occur with the drug and the adverse reactions perti-nent to them. Particularly susceptible patient populations shall be identified. \\n(3) Dependence. This subsection of the \\nlabeling shall describe characteristic effects resulting from both psycho-logical and physical dependence that \\noccur with the drug and shall identify the quantity of the drug over a period of time that may lead to tolerance or dependence, or both. Details shall be provided on the adverse effects of chronic abuse and the effects of abrupt withdrawal. Procedures necessary to diagnose the dependent state shall be provided, and the principles of treating the effects of abrupt withdrawal shall be described. \\n(i) Overdosage. Under this section \\nheading, the labeling shall describe the signs, symptoms, and laboratory find-ings of acute overdosage and the gen-eral principles of treatment. This sec-tion shall be based on human data, when available. If human data are un-available, appropriate animal and in vitro data may be used. Specific infor-mation shall be provided about the fol-lowing: \\n(1) Signs, symptoms, and laboratory \\nfindings associated with an overdosage of the drug. \\n(2) Complications that can occur with \\nthe drug (for example, organ toxicity or delayed acidosis). \\n(3) Oral LD\\n50of the drug in animals; \\nconcentrations of the drug in biologic fluids associated with toxicity and/or death; physiologic variables influ-encing excretion of the drug, such as urine pH; and factors that influence the dose response relationship of the drug, such as tolerance. The pharmaco-kinetic data given in the ‘‘Clinical Pharmacology’’ section also may be \\nreferenced here, if applicable to overdoses. \\n(4) The amount of the drug in a single \\ndose that is ordinarily associated with symptoms of overdosage and the amount of the drug in a single dose that is likely to be life-threatening. \\n(5) Whether the drug is dialyzable.

This \\nsection of the labeling shall state the recommended usual dose, the usual dosage range, and, if appropriate, an upper limit beyond which safety and ef-fectiveness have not been established; dosages shall be stated for each indica-tion when appropriate. Dosing regi-mens must not be implied or suggested in other sections of labeling if not in-cluded in this section. This section shall also state the intervals rec-ommended between doses, the optimal method of titrating dosage, the usual duration of treatment, and any modi-fication of dosage needed in special pa-tient populations, e.g., in children, in geriatric age groups, or in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Specific tables or monographs may be included to clarify dosage schedules. Radiation dosimetry information shall be stated for both the patient receiving a radio-active drug and the person admin-istering it. This section shall also con-tain specific direction on dilution, preparation (including the strength of the final dosage solution, when pre-pared according to instructions, in terms of milligrams active ingredient per milliliter of reconstituted solution, unless another measure of the strength is more appropriate), and administra-tion of the dosage form, if needed, e.g., the rate of administration of paren-teral drug in milligrams per minute; storage conditions for stability of the drug or reconstituted drug, when im-portant; essential information on drug incompatibilities if the drug is mixed in vitro with other drugs; and the fol-lowing statement for parenterals: ‘‘Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate mat-ter and discoloration prior to adminis-tration, whenever solution and con-tainer permit.’’ \\n(k) How Supplied. This section of the \\nlabeling shall contain information on the available dosage forms to which the labeling applies and for which the manufacturer or distributor is respon-sible. The information shall ordinarily include: \\n(1) The strength of the dosage form, \\ne.g., 10-milligram tablets, in metric system and, if the apothecary system is used, a statement of the strength is \\nplaced in parentheses after the metric designation; \\n(2) The units in which the dosage \\nform is ordinarily available for pre-scribing by practitioners, e.g., bottles of 100; \\n(3) Appropriate information to facili-\\ntate identification of the dosage forms, such as shape, color, coating, scoring, and National Drug Code; and \\n(4) Special handling and storage con-\\nditions. \\n(l) Animal Pharmacology and/or Animal \\nToxicology. In most cases, the labeling \\nneed not include this section. Signifi-cant animal data necessary for safe and effective use of the drug in humans shall ordinarily be included in one or more of the other sections of the label-ing, as appropriate. Commonly for a drug that has been marketed for a long time, and in rare cases for a new drug, chronic animal toxicity studies have not been performed or completed for a drug that is administered over pro-longed periods or is implanted in the body. The unavailability of such data shall be stated in the appropriate sec-tion of the labeling for the drug. If the pertinent animal data cannot be appro-priately incorporated into other sec-tions of the labeling, this section may be used. \\n(m) ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ and ‘‘Ref-\\nerences’’. These sections may appear in \\nlabeling in the place of a detailed dis-cussion of a subject that is of limited interest but nonetheless important. A reference to a specific important clin-ical study may be made in any section of the format required under §§201.56 and 201.57 if the study is essential to an understandable presentation of the available information. References may appear in sections of the labeling for-mat, other than the ‘‘Clinical Studies’’ or ‘‘References’’ section, in rare cir-cumstances only. A clinical study or reference may be cited in prescription drug labeling only under the following conditions: \\n(1)(i) If the clinical study is cited in \\nthe labeling in place of a detailed dis-cussion of data and information con-cerning an indication for use of the drug, the clinical study must con-stitute an adequate and well-controlled study as described in §314.126(b) of this \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '64', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The intent may be shown by such persons’ expres-sions, the design or composition of the article, or by the circumstances sur-rounding the distribution of the arti-cle. This objective intent may, for ex-ample, be shown by labeling claims, ad-vertising matter, or oral or written statements by such persons or their representatives. Objective intent may be shown, for example, by cir-cumstances in which the article is, with the knowledge of such persons or their representatives, offered or used for a purpose for which it is neither la-beled nor advertised; provided, how-ever, that a firm would not be regarded as intending an unapproved new use for an approved drug based solely on that firm’s knowledge that such drug was being prescribed or used by health care providers for such use. The intended uses of an article may change after it has been introduced into interstate commerce by its manufacturer.

      "page_content='77 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 201.200 \\nSubpart F—Labeling Claims for \\nDrugs in Drug Efficacy Study \\n§ 201.200 Disclosure of drug efficacy \\nstudy evaluations in labeling and advertising. \\n(a)(1) The National Academy of \\nSciences—National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, has com-pleted an exhaustive review of labeling claims made for drugs marketed under new-drug and antibiotic drug proce-\\ndures between 1938 and 1962. The results are compiled in ‘‘Drug Efficacy Study, A Report to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs from the National Academy of Sciences (1969).’’ As the report notes, this review has made ‘‘an audit of the state of the art of drug usage that has been uniquely extensive in scope and uniquely intensive in time’’ and is ap-plicable to more than 80 percent of the currently marketed drugs. The report further notes that the quality of the evidence of efficacy, as well as the quality of the labeling claims, is poor. Labeling and other promotional claims have been evaluated as ‘‘effective,’’ ‘‘probably effective,’’ ‘‘possibly effec-tive,’’ ‘‘ineffective,’’ ‘‘ineffective as a fixed combination,’’ and ‘‘effective but,’’ and a report for each drug in the study has been submitted to the Com-missioner. \\n(2) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion is processing the reports, seeking voluntary action on the part of the drug manufacturers and distributors in the elimination or modification of un-supported promotional claims, and ini-tiating administrative actions as nec-essary to require product and labeling changes. \\n(3) Delays have been encountered in \\nbringing to the attention of the pre-scribers of prescription items the con-clusions of the expert panels that re-viewed the promotional claims. \\n(b) The Commissioner of Food and \\nDrugs concludes that: \\n(1) The failure to disclose in the la-\\nbeling of a drug and in other pro-motional material the conclusions of the Academy experts that a claim is ‘‘ineffective,’’ ‘‘possibly effective,’’ ‘‘probably effective,’’ or ‘‘ineffective as a fixed combination,’’ while labeling and promotional material bearing any such claim are being used, is a failure to disclose facts that are material in \\nlight of the representations made and causes the drug to be misbranded. \\n(2) The Academy classification of a \\ndrug as other than ‘‘effective’’ for a claim for which such drug is rec-ommended establishes that there is a material weight of opinion among qualified experts contrary to the rep-resentation made or suggested in the labeling, and failure to reveal this fact causes such labeling to be misleading. \\n(c) Therefore, after publication in the \\nF\\nEDERAL REGISTER of a Drug Efficacy \\nStudy Implementation notice on a pre-scription drug, unless exempted or oth-erwise provided for in the notice, all package labeling (other than the im-mediate container or carton label, un-less such labeling contains information required by §201.100(c)(1) in lieu of a package insert), promotional labeling, and advertisements shall include, as part of the information for practi-tioners under which the drug can be safely and effectively used, an appro-priate qualification of all claims evalu-ated as other than ‘‘effective’’ by a panel of the National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council, Drug Efficacy Study Group, if such claims continue to be included in ei-ther the labeling or advertisements. However, this qualifying information will be required in advertisements only if promotional material is included therein for claims evaluated as less than ‘‘effective’’ or if such claims are included in the indications section of the portion of the advertisement con-taining the information required in brief summary by §202.1(e)(1) of this chapter. When, however, the Food and Drug Administration classification of such claim is ‘‘effective’’ (for example, on the basis of revision of the language of the claim or submission or existence of adequate data), such qualification is not necessary. When the Food and Drug Administration classification of the claim, as stated in the implementation notice, differs from that of the Acad-emy but is other than ‘‘effective,’’ the qualifying statement shall refer to this classification in lieu of the Academy’s classification. \\n(d) For new drugs and antibiotics, \\nsupplements to provide for revised la-beling in accord with paragraph (c) of \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00087 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '73', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The Food and Drug Administration will identify these situ-ations in direct correspondence with the drug promoters, after which the failure to make the disclosure will be regarded as misleading and appropriate action will be taken. \\n[40 FR 13998, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 55 \\nFR 11576, Mar. 29, 1990] \\nSubpart G—Specific Labeling Re-\\nquirements for Specific Drug Products \\n§ 201.300 Notice to manufacturers, \\npackers, and distributors of glan-dular preparations. \\n(a) Under date of December 4, 1941, in \\na notice to manufacturers of glandular preparations, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration expressed the opinion that preparations of inert glandular materials intended for medicinal use should, in view of the requirement of section 201(n) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (52 Stat. 1041; 21 U.S.C. 321(n)), be labeled with a statement of the material fact that there is no scientific evidence that the articles contain any therapeutic or physiologically active constituents. Numerous preparations of such inert glandular materials were subsequently marketed with disclaimers of the type suggested. The term inert glandular ma-\\nterials means preparations incapable of \\nexerting an action or effect of some significant or measurable benefit in one way or another, i.e., in the diag-nosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or in affecting the structure or any function of the body. (b) Manufacturers have heretofore \\ntaken advantage of §201.100 permitting omission of directions for use when the label bears the prescription legend. Section 201.100(c) requires that the la-beling of the drug, which may include brochures readily available to licensed practitioners, bear information as to the use of the drug by practitioners li-censed by law to administer it. Obvi-ously, information adequate for the use of an inert glandular preparation is not available to practitioners licensed by law. \\n(c) The Department of Health and \\nHuman Services is of the opinion that inert glandular materials may not be exempted from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the act that they bear adequate directions for use; and, accordingly, that their labeling must include among other things, represen-tations as to the conditions for which such articles are intended to be used or as to the structure or function of the human body that they are intended to affect. Since any such representations offering these articles for use as drugs would be false or misleading, such arti-cles will be considered to be mis-branded if they are distributed for use as drugs. \\n(d) The amended regulations provide \\nalso that in the case of drugs intended for parenteral administration there shall be no exemption from the require-ment that their labelings bear ade-quate directions for use. Such inert glandular materials for parenteral use are therefore subject to the same com-ment as applies to those intended for oral administration. \\n§ 201.301 Notice to manufacturers, \\npackers, and distributors of estro-genic hormone preparations. \\nSome drug preparations fabricated \\nwholly or in part from estradiol and la-beled as to potency in terms of inter-national units or in terms of inter-national units of estrone activity have been marketed. The international unit of the estrus-producing hormone was established by the International Con-ference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones at London, England, on Au-gust 1, 1932. This unit was defined as ‘‘the specific estrus-producing activity contained in 0.1 gamma ( = 0.0001 mg.) \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00089 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '75', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The International Conference declared that it did not recommend the determina-tion of the activity of nonhydroxyketonic forms of estrogenic hormones in units of estrone because of the varying ratios between the activity of such nonhydroxyketonic estrogenic hormones and estrone, when measured by different methods on test animals. There is no international unit for measuring the activity of estradiol and no accepted relationship between its activity and that of estrone, either in test animals or in humans. The dec-laration of potency of estradiol in terms of international units or in terms of international units of estrone activity is therefore considered mis-leading, within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. 352(a). The declaration of the es-tradiol content of an estrogenic hor-mone preparation in terms of weight is considered appropriate. \\n§ 201.302 Notice to manufacturers, \\npackers, and distributors of drugs for internal use which contain min-\\neral oil. \\n(a) In the past few years research \\nstudies have altered medical opinion as to the usefulness and harmfulness of mineral oil in the human body. These studies have indicated that when min-eral oil is used orally near mealtime it interferes with absorption from the di-gestive tract of provitamin A and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and K, and consequently interferes with the utili-zation of calcium and phosphorus, with the result that the user is left liable to deficiency diseases. When so used in pregnancy it predisposes to hemor-rhagic disease of the newborn. \\n(b) There is accumulated evidence \\nthat the indiscriminate administration of mineral oil to infants may be fol-lowed by aspiration of the mineral oil and subsequent ‘‘lipoid pneumonia.’’ \\n(c) In view of these facts, the Depart-\\nment of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act a drug for oral ad-ministration consisting in whole or in part of mineral oil, the labeling of which encourages its use in pregnancy or indicates or implies that such drug \\nis for administration to infants. \\n(d) It is also this Department’s view \\nthat the act requires the labelings of such drugs to bear a warning against consumption other than at bedtime and against administration to infants. The following form of warning is sug-gested: ‘‘Caution: To be taken only at bedtime. Do not use at any other time or administer to infants, except upon the advice of a physician.’’ \\n(e) This statement of interpretation \\ndoes not in any way exempt mineral oil or preparations containing mineral oil from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n§ 201.303 Labeling of drug prepara-\\ntions containing significant propor-tions of wintergreen oil. \\n(a) Because methyl salicylate (win-\\ntergreen oil) manifests no toxicity in the minute amounts in which it is used as a flavoring, it is mistakenly re-garded by the public as harmless even when taken in substantially larger amounts. Actually, it is quite toxic when taken in quantities of a teaspoon-ful or more. Wintergreen oil and prep-arations containing it have caused a number of deaths through accidental misuse by both adults and children. Children are particularly attracted by the odor and are likely to swallow these products when left within reach. \\n(b) To safeguard against fatalities \\nfrom this cause, the Department of Health and Human Services will regard as misbranded under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act any drug containing more than 5 percent methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil), the labeling of which fails to warn that use otherwise than as directed therein may be dangerous and that the article should be kept out of reach of children to prevent accidental poi-soning. \\n(c) This statement of interpretation \\nin no way exempts methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil) or its preparations from complying in all other respects with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '76', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Tannic acid is capable of causing di-minished liver function and severe liver necrosis when absorbed in suffi-cient amounts. The medical literature reports a number of deaths associated with the addition of tannic acid to bar-ium enemas. There is a lack of sci-entific evidence to establish the condi-tions, if any, under which tannic acid is safe and effective for use in enemas. Tannic acid for rectal use to enhance X-ray visualization is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n(b) In view of the hazards involved \\nwhen tannic acid is used in barium en-emas, any shipments of tannic acid la-beled to come within the exemptions under 502(f) of the Act containing such phrases as: ‘‘Caution: For manufac-turing, processing, or repackaging,’’ ‘‘For prescription compounding,’’ or ‘‘Diagnostic reagent—For professional use only’’ will be regarded by the Com-missioner of Food and Drugs as mis-branded within the meaning of section 502(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless the label and the labeling bear conspicuously a warning to the effect: ‘‘ Warning— Not for use in \\nenemas.’’ \\n(c) Any tannic acid intended for use \\nby man and found within the jurisdic-tion of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act labeled contrary to this section after 60 days from the date of its publication in the F\\nEDERAL REG-\\nISTER may be made the subject of regu-\\nlatory proceedings. \\n§ 201.305 Isoproterenol inhalation \\npreparations (pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, powders) for human use; warnings. \\n(a) Accumulating reports have been \\nreceived by the Food and Drug Admin-istration and have appeared in the medical literature of severe paradox-ical bronchoconstriction associated with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations in the treatment of bronchial asthma and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders. The cause of this paradoxical \\nreaction is unknown; it has been ob-served, however, that patients have not responded completely to other forms of therapy until use of the isoproterenol inhalation preparation was discon-tinued. In addition, sudden unexpected deaths have been associated with the excessive use of isoproterenol inhala-tion preparations. The mechanism of these deaths and their relationship, if any, to the cases of severe paradoxical bronchospasm are not clear. Cardiac arrest was noted in several of these cases of sudden death. \\n(b) On the basis of the above informa-\\ntion and after discussion with and con-currence of the Respiratory and Anes-thetic Drugs Advisory Committee for Food and Drug Administration, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs con-cludes that in order for the labeling of such drugs to bear adequate informa-tion for their safe use, as required by §201.100, such labeling must include the following: \\nWarning: Occasional patients have been re-\\nported to develop severe paradoxical airway resistance with repeated, excessive use of isoproterenol inhalation preparations. The cause of this refractory state is unknown. It is advisable that in such instances the use of this preparation be discontinued imme-diately and alternative therapy instituted, since in the reported cases the patients did not respond to other forms of therapy until the drug was withdrawn. \\nDeaths have been reported following exces-\\nsive use of isoproterenol inhalation prepara-tions and the exact cause is unknown. Car-diac arrest was noted in several instances. \\n(c)(1) The Commissioner also con-\\ncludes that in view of the manner in which these preparations are self-ad-ministered for relief of attacks of bron-chial asthma and other chronic bron-chopulmonary disorders, it is necessary for the protection of users that warn-ing information to patients be included as a part of the label and as part of any instructions to patients included in the package dispensed to the patient as fol-lows: \\nWarning: Do not exceed the dose prescribed \\nby your physician.

These lesions may occur with enteric-coated potassium tablets alone or when they are used with nonenteric-coated thiazides, or certain other oral diuretics. These small-bowel lesions have caused obstruction, hemorrhage, and perforation. Surgery was frequently required and deaths have occurred. Based on a large survey of physicians and hospitals, both United States and foreign, the incidence of these lesions is low, and a causal relation-ship in man has not been definitely estab-lished. Available information tends to impli-\\ncate enteric-coated potassium salts, al-though lesions of this type also occur spon-taneously. Therefore, coated potassium-con-taining formulations should be administered only when indicated, and should be discon-tinued immediately if abdominal pain, dis-tention, nausea, vomiting, or gastro-intestinal bleeding occur. Coated potassium tablets should be used only when adequate dietary supplementation is not practicable. \\n(Although the warning statement in-\\ncludes references to enteric-coated po-tassium salt preparations, it applies to any capsule or coated tablet of a potas-sium salt intended for oral ingestion without prior dilution with an ade-quate volume of liquid to preclude gas-trointestinal injury.) \\n(iii) Any other labeling or additional \\nadvertising for the drug conforms to the labeling described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, in accordance with §§202.1 and 201.100 of this chapter. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '78', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

So-dium phosphates oral solution has been marketed in 45-milliliter (mL), 90-mL, and 240-mL container sizes. The 45-mL \\nand 90-mL container sizes of sodium phosphates oral solution are often rec-ommended and prescribed by physi-cians for bowel cleansing prior to sur-gery and diagnostic procedures of the colon. Sodium phosphates oral solution (adult dose 20 mL to 45 mL) is also used as an over-the-counter (OTC) laxative for the relief of occasional constipa-tion. Accidental overdosing and deaths have occurred because the 240-mL con-tainer was mistakenly used instead of the 45-mL or 90-mL container. The Food and Drug Administration is lim-iting the amount of sodium phosphates oral solution to not more than 90 mL (3 ounces (oz)) per OTC container because of the serious health risks associated with the ingestion of larger than in-tended doses of this product. Further, because an overdose of either oral or rectal enema sodium phosphates can cause an electrolyte imbalance, addi-tional warning and direction state-ments are required for the safe use of any OTC laxative drug product con-taining sodium phosphates. \\n(b) Any OTC drug product for lax-\\native or bowel cleansing use containing sodium phosphates as an active ingre-dient when marketed as described in paragraph (a) of this section is mis-branded within the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act unless packaged and labeled as follows: \\n(1) Package size limitation for so-\\ndium phosphates oral solution: Con-tainer shall not contain more than 90 mL (3 oz). \\n(2) Warnings.

In the emergency treatment of these poisonings, ipecac syrup is considered the emetic of choice. The immediate availability of \\nthis drug for use in such situations is critical, since rapid treatment may be the difference between life and death. The restriction of this drug to prescrip-tion sale limits its availability in emergencies. On the other hand, it is the consensus of informed medical opinion that ipecac syrup should be used only under medical supervision in the emergency treatment of poisonings. In view of these facts, the question of whether ipecac syrup la-beled as an emergency treatment for use in poisonings should be available over the counter has been controver-sial. \\n(b) In connection with its study of \\nthis problem, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration has obtained the views of medical authorities. It is the unani-mous recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the American Medical Association, and the Medical Advisory Board of the Food and Drug Administration that ip-ecac syrup in 1 fluid ounce containers be permitted to be sold without pre-scription so that it will be readily available in the household for emer-gency treatment of poisonings, under medical supervision, and that the drug be appropriately packaged and labeled for this purpose. \\n(c) In view of the above recommenda-\\ntions, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that it is in the interest of the public health for ipecac syrup to be available for sale without prescription, provided that it is pack-aged in a quantity of 1 fluid ounce (30 milliliters), and its label bears, in addi-tion to other required label informa-tion, the following, in a prominent and conspicuous manner: \\n(1) A statement conspicuously boxed \\nand in red letters, to the effect: ‘‘For emergency use to cause vomiting in poisoning.

This study led to the decision that there was probable cause to conclude that misuse and pro-longed use of the drug were in fact re-sponsible for kidney lesions and dis-ease. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in December 1963, appointed an ad hoc Advisory Committee of Inquiry on Possible Nephrotoxicity Associated With the Abuse of Acetophenetidin (Phenacetin)-Containing Preparations. This committee, composed of scientists in the fields of pharmacology and med-icine, on April 23, 1964, submitted its findings and conclusions in the matter and recommended that all acetophe-netidin (phenacetin)-containing prep-arations bear a warning as provided in section 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n(b) On the basis of the studies made \\nby the Food and Drug Administration and the report of the Advisory Com-mittee, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that it is nec-essary for the protection of users that the label and labeling of all acetophe-netidin (phenacetin)-containing prep-arations bear a warning statement to the following effect: ‘‘Warning—This medication may damage the kidneys when used in large amounts or for a long period of time. Do not take more than the recommended dosage, nor take regularly for longer than 10 days without consulting your physician.’’ \\n§ 201.310 Phenindione; labeling of \\ndrug preparations intended for use by man. \\n(a) Reports in the medical literature \\nand data accumulated by the Food and Drug Administration indicate that phenindione, a synthetic anticoagulant \\ndrug, has caused a number of cases of agranulocytosis (with two fatalities). There are also reports implicating the drug in cases of hepatitis and hyper-sensitivity reactions. In view of the po-tentially serious effects found to be as-sociated with preparations of this drug intended for use by man, the Commis-sioner of Food and Drugs will regard such preparations as misbranded with-in the meaning of section 502(f) (1) and (2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act, unless the label and label-ing on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed, and any other labeling furnishing or pur-porting to furnish information for use of the drug, bear a conspicuous warn-ing statement to the following effect: ‘‘Warning: Agranulocytosis and hepa-titis have been associated with the use of phenindione. Patients should be in-structed to report promptly prodromal symptoms such as marked fatigue, chill, fever, and sore throat. Periodic blood studies and liver function tests should be performed. Use of the drug should be discontinued if leukopenia occurs or if evidence of hyper-sensitivity, such as dermatitis or fever, appears.’’ \\n(b) Regulatory action may be initi-\\nated with respect to preparations of phenindione intended for use by man found within the jurisdiction of the act on or after November 25, 1961, unless such preparations are labeled in ac-cordance with paragraph (a) of this sec-tion. \\n§ 201.311 [Reserved] \\n§ 201.312 Magnesium sulfate \\nheptahydrate; label declaration on drug products. \\nMagnesium sulfate heptahydrate \\nshould be listed on the label of a drug product as epsom salt, which is its common or usual name. \\n§ 201.313 Estradiol labeling. \\nThe article presently recognized in \\nThe National Formulary under the heading ‘‘Estradiol’’ and which is said to be ‘‘17-cis-beta estradiol’’ is the same substance formerly recognized in the United States Pharmacopeia under the designation ‘‘Alpha Estradiol.’’ The \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '81', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

These effects may increase the risk of transmission of the AIDS virus (HIV) from an in-fected partner. Therefore, consumers should be warned that these products do not protect against the trans-mission of the AIDS virus (HIV) or other STDs, that use of these products can increase vaginal and rectal irrita-tion, which may increase the risk of getting the AIDS virus (HIV) from an HIV infected partner, and that the products are not for rectal use.

The delivered dose to the UV exposure site must be within 10 percent of the expected dose. \\n(iv) Periodic measurement. To ensure \\nthat the solar simulator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, the emission spectrum of the solar sim-ulator should be measured at least an-nually with an appropriate and accu-rately calibrated spectroradiometer system (results should be traceable to the National Institute for Standards and Technology). In addition, the solar simulator must be recalibrated if there is any change in the lamp bulb or the optical filtering components ( i.e., fil-\\nters, mirrors, lenses, collimating de-vices, or focusing devices). Daily solar simulator radiation intensity should be monitored with a broadband radiom-eter with a response weighted to match the erythema action spectrum in ISO 17166 CIE S 007/E entitled ‘‘Erythemal reference action spectrum and standard erythema dose,’’ which is incorporated by reference in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(C) of this section. If a lamp must be replaced due to failure or aging during a phototest, broadband device readings consistent with those obtained for the original calibrated lamp will suffice until measurements can be performed with the spectroradiometer at the ear-liest possible opportunity. \\n(2) SPF standard —(i) Preparation.

A suitable source of low power UVA, such as a Woods lamp, is helpful in this process. If any of these condi-tions are present, the subject is not qualified to participate in the study. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if, in the phy-sician’s judgment, they will neither compromise the study nor jeopardize a subject’s safety. Subjects with dysplastic nevi should not be enrolled. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped. Shaving is unac-ceptable because it may remove a sig-nificant portion of the stratum corneum and temporarily alter the skin’s response to UV radiation. \\n(iv) Informed consent. Obtain legally \\neffective written informed consent from all test subjects. \\n(4) Sunscreen application. (i) Test site. \\nTest sites are locations on each sub-ject’s back, between the beltline and the shoulder blades (scapulae) and lat-eral to the midline, where skin re-sponses to UV radiation are deter-mined. Responses on unprotected skin (no test material applied) and pro-tected skin (sunscreen test product(s) or SPF standard applied) are deter-mined at separate unprotected and pro-tected test sites, respectively. Test sites should be randomly located in a blinded manner. Each test site should be a minimum of 30 square centimeters and outlined with indelible ink. \\n(ii) Test subsite. Test subsites are the \\nlocations to which UV radiation is ad-ministered within a test site. At least five test subsites should receive UV doses within each test site. Test subsites should be at least 0.5 square centimeters (cm\\n2) in area and should be \\nseparated from each other by at least 0.8 cm. Each test subsite should be out-lined with indelible ink. \\n(iii) Applying test materials. Apply the \\nsunscreen test product and the SPF standard at 2 milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm\\n2) to their respective \\ntest sites. Use a finger cot compatible with the sunscreen to spread the prod-uct as evenly as possible. \\n(iv) Waiting period. Wait at least 15 \\nminutes after applying a sunscreen product before exposing the test sites to UV radiation as described in para-\\ngraph (i)(5)) of this section. For water resistant sunscreen products, proceed with the water resistance testing pro-cedure described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section after waiting at least 15 minutes. \\n(5) UV exposure —(i) Definition of mini-\\nmal erythema dose (MED). The minimal \\nerythema dose (MED) is the smallest UV dose that produces perceptible red-ness of the skin (erythema) with clear-ly defined borders at 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The MED for unpro-tected skin (MED\\nu) is determined on a \\ntest site that does not have sunscreen applied. The MED for protected skin (MED\\np) is determined on a test site \\nthat has sunscreen applied. An MED pis \\ndetermined for the SPF standard (ssMED\\np). An MED pis determined for \\nthe sunscreen test product (tpMED p). \\n(ii) UV exposure for initial MED u. For \\neach test subject, administer a series of UV radiation doses expressed as J/m\\n2- \\neff (as determined according to para-graph (a)(2) of this section) to the test subsites within an unprotected test site using an accurately calibrated solar simulator. Select doses that are a geometric series represented by 1.25\\nn \\n(i.e., each dose is 25 percent greater \\nthan the previous dose). \\n(iii) UV exposure for final MED u, \\nssMED p, and tpMED p. For each subject, \\ndetermine the final MED u, ssMED p, and \\ntpMED pby administering a series of \\nfive UV doses to the appropriate test sites. The middle dose (X) in each of these dose series ( i.e., the third dose) \\nshould equal the initial MED\\nutimes \\nthe expected SPF. Note that the ex-pected SPF equals 1 and 16.3 for the final MED\\nuand ssMED p, respectively. \\nThe remaining UV doses in the series depend upon the expected SPF value of the sunscreen test product(s). \\nFor products with an expected SPF \\nless than 8, administer UV doses that increase by 25 percent with each suc-cessive dose ( i.e., 0.64X, 0.80X, 1.00X, \\n1.25X, and 1.56X). For products with an expected SPF from 8 to 15, administer UV doses that increase by 20 percent with each successive dose ( i.e., 0.69X, \\n0.83X, 1.00X, 1.20X, and 1.44X). For prod-ucts with an expected SPF higher than 15, administer UV doses that increase by 15 percent with each successive dose \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00111 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '97', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In \\norder that the person who evaluates the test subsites is not biased, he/she should not be the same person who ap-plied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or administered the UV doses. After UV doses are administered, all immediate responses should be re-corded. These may include an imme-diate darkening or tanning, typically grayish or purplish in color, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes; an immediate reddening at the subsite, due to heat-ing of the skin, which fades rapidly; and an immediate generalized heat re-sponse, spreading beyond the subsite, which fades in 30 to 60 minutes. After the immediate responses are noted, each subject should shield the exposed area from further UV radiation until the MED is determined. Determine the MED 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. Because erythema is evaluated 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure, the final MED\\nu, ssMED p, and tpMED pare typi-\\ncally determined the day following de-termination of the initial MED\\nu. Evalu-\\nate the erythema responses of each test subsite using either tungsten or warm \\nwhite fluorescent lighting that pro-vides at least 450 lux of illumination at the test site. For the evaluation, the test subject should be in the same posi-tion as when the test site was irradi-ated. \\n(v) Invalid test data. Reject test data \\nfor a test subject if erythema is not present on either the unprotected or protected test sites; or erythema is present at all subsites; or the responses are inconsistent with the series of UV doses administered; or the subject was noncompliant (e.g., the subject with-draws from the test due to illness or work conflicts or does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is deter-mined). \\n(6) Determination of SPF. (i) Calculate \\nan SPF value for each test subject (SPF\\ni) as follows: \\n(ii) Calculate the mean \\nand the standard deviation (s) from the \\nSPF ivalues. Calculate the standard \\nerror (SE), which equals s/ √n (where n \\nequals the number of subjects who pro-vided valid test results). Obtain the t value from Student’s t distribution table corresponding to the upper 5-per-cent point with n—1 degrees of free-dom. Determine the labeled SPF value, which equals the largest whole number less than \\nIn order for the SPF determination of a test product to be considered valid, the SPF value of the SPF standard should fall within the standard devi-ation range of the expected SPF ( i.e., \\n16.3 ±3.43). \\n(7) Determination of water resistance. \\nThe following procedure should be per-formed in an indoor fresh water pool, whirlpool, and/or hot tub maintained at 23 to 32 °C. Fresh water is clean \\ndrinking water that meets the stand-ards in 40 CFR part 141. The pool and air temperature and the relative hu-midity should be recorded. \\n(i) Water resistance (40 minutes). The \\nlabeled SPF should be determined after 40 minutes of water immersion using the following procedure: \\n(A) Step 1: Apply the sunscreen as de-\\nscribed in paragraph (d) of this section. \\n(B) Step 2: Perform moderate activ-\\nity in water for 20 minutes. \\n(C) Step 3: Rest out of water for 15 \\nminutes.

(i) Plate. Use optical- \\ngrade polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates suitable for UV trans-mittance measurements. The plate should be roughened on one side to a three dimensional surface topography measure (Sa) between 2 and 7 microm-eters and must have a rectangular ap-plication area of at least 16 square cen-timeters (with no side shorter than 4 cm). \\n(ii) Sample holder. The sample holder \\nshould hold the PMMA plate in a hori-zontal position to avoid flowing of the sunscreen drug product from one edge of the PMMA plate to the other. It should be mounted as close as possible to the input optics of the spectrometer to maximize capture of forward scat-tered radiation. The sample holder should be a thin, flat plate with a suit-able aperture through which UV radi-ation can pass. The PMMA plate should be placed on the upper surface of the sample holder with the roughened side facing up. \\n(iii) Light source. The light source \\nshould produce a continuous spectral distribution of UV radiation from 290 to 400 nanometers. \\n(iv) Input optics. Unless the spectrom-\\neter is equipped with an integrating sphere, an ultraviolet radiation dif-fuser should be placed between the sample and the input optics of the spectrometer. The diffuser will be con-structed from any UV radiation trans-parent material (e.g., Teflon\\n®or quartz). The diffuser ensures that the \\nradiation received by the spectrometer is not collimated. The spectrometer input slits should be set to provide a bandwidth that is less than or equal to 1 nanometer. \\n(v) Dynamic range of the spectrometer. \\nThe dynamic range of the spectrometer should be sufficient to measure trans-mittance accurately through a highly absorbing sunscreen product at all ter-restrial solar UV wavelengths (290 to 400 nm). \\n(2) Sunscreen product application to \\nPMMA plate. The accuracy of the test \\ndepends upon the application of a pre-cisely controlled amount of sunscreen product with a uniform distribution over the PMMA plate. The product is applied at 0.75 mg per square centi-meter to the roughened side of the PMMA plate. The sunscreen product should be applied in a series of small dots over the entire PMMA plate and then spread evenly using a gloved fin-ger. Spreading should be done with a very light spreading action for approxi-mately 30 seconds followed by spread-ing with greater pressure for approxi-mately 30 seconds. The plate should then be allowed to equilibrate for 15 minutes in the dark before the pre-irra-diation described in paragraph (c) of this section. \\n(3) Sunscreen product pre-irradiation. \\nTo account for lack of photostability, apply the sunscreen product to the PMMA plate as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then irradiate with a solar simulator described in sec-tion 352.70(b) of this chapter. The irra-diation dose should be 4 MEDs which is equivalent to an erythemal effective dose of 800 J/m\\n2(i.e., 800 J/m2-eff). \\n(4) Calculation of mean transmittance \\nvalues. After pre-irradiation described \\nin paragraph (c) of this section, mean transmittance values should be deter-mined for each wavelength λ over the \\nfull UV spectrum (290 to 400 nano-meters). The transmittance values should be measured at 1 nanometer in-tervals. Measurements of spectral irra-diance transmitted for each wave-length λ through control PMMA plates \\ncoated with 15 microliters of glycerin (no sunscreen product) should be ob-tained from at least 5 different loca-tions on the PMMA plate [C1( λ), C2( λ), \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00113 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '99', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For each sun-\\nscreen product, mean absorbance val-ues should be determined from at least three individual PMMA plates. Because paragraph (d) of this section requires at least 5 measurements per plate, there should be a total of at least 15 measurements. \\n(7) Calculation of the critical wave-\\nlength. The critical wavelength is iden-\\ntified as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance \\ncurve reaches 90 percent of the integral over the UV spectrum from 290 to 400 nm.

The fol-\\nlowing advertisements are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section under the condi-tions specified: \\n(i) Reminder advertisements. Reminder \\nadvertisements are those which call at-tention to the name of the drug prod-uct but do not include indications or dosage recommendations for use of the drug product. These reminder adver-tisements shall contain only the pro-prietary name of the drug product, if any; the established name of the drug product, if any; the established name of each active ingredient in the drug product; and, optionally, information relating to quantitative ingredient statements, dosage form, quantity of package contents, price, the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor or other written, printed, or graphic matter containing no rep-resentation or suggestion relating to the advertised drug product. If the Commissioner finds that there is evi-dence of significant incidence of fatali-ties or serious injury associated with the use of a particular prescription drug, he may withdraw this exemption by so notifying the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the drug by letter. Reminder advertisements, other than those solely intended to convey \\nprice information including, but not limited to, those subject to the require-ments of §200.200 of this chapter, are not permitted for a prescription drug product whose labeling contains a boxed warning relating to a serious hazard associated with the use of the drug product. Reminder advertise-ments which are intended to provide consumers with information con-cerning the price charged for a pre-scription for a drug product are exempt from the requirements of this section if they meet all of the conditions con-tained in §200.200 of this chapter. Re-minder advertisements, other than those subject to the requirements of §200.200 of this chapter, are not per-mitted for a drug for which an an-\\nnouncement has been published pursu-ant to a review on the labeling claims for the drug by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group, and for which no claim has been evaluated as higher than ‘‘possibly ef-fective.’’ If the Commissioner finds the circumstances are such that a re-minder advertisement may be mis-leading to prescribers of drugs subject to NAS/NRC evaluation, such adver-tisements will not be allowed and the manufacturer, packer, or distributor will be notified either in the publica-tion of the conclusions on the effec-tiveness of the drug or by letter. \\n(ii) Advertisements of bulk-sale drugs. \\nAdvertisements of bulk-sale drugs that promote sale of the drug in bulk pack-ages in accordance with the practice of the trade solely to be processed, manu-factured, labeled, or repackaged in sub-stantial quantities and that contain no claims for the therapeutic safety or ef-fectiveness of the drug. \\n(iii) Advertisements of prescription- \\ncompounding drugs.

Untrue or misleading information in any part of the advertisement will not be corrected by the inclusion in an-other distinct part of the advertise-ment of a brief statement containing true information relating to side ef-fects, contraindications, and effective-ness of the drug. If any part or theme of the advertisement would make the advertisement false or misleading by reason of the omission of appropriate qualification or pertinent information, that part or theme shall include the appropriate qualification or pertinent information, which may be concise if it is supplemented by a prominent ref-erence on each page to the presence and location elsewhere in the adver-tisement of a more complete discussion of such qualification or information. \\n(ii) The information relating to effec-\\ntiveness is not required to include in-formation relating to all purposes for which the drug is intended but may op-tionally be limited to a true statement of the effectiveness of the drug for the selected purpose(s) for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the ad-vertisement. The information relating to effectiveness shall include specific indications for use of the drug for pur-poses claimed in the advertisement; for example, when an advertisement con-tains a broad claim that a drug is an antibacterial agent, the advertisement shall name a type or types of infections and microorganisms for which the drug is effective clinically as specifically as required, approved, or permitted in the drug package labeling. \\n(iii) The information relating to side \\neffects and contraindications shall dis-close each specific side effect and con-traindication (which include side ef-fects, warnings, precautions, and con-traindications and include any such in-formation under such headings as cau-tions, special considerations, impor-tant notes, etc.; see paragraph (e)(1) of this section) contained in required, ap-proved, or permitted labeling for the advertised drug dosage form(s): Pro-\\nvided, however, (a) The side effects and contraindica-\\ntions disclosed may be limited to those pertinent to the indications for which the drug is recommended or suggested in the advertisement to the extent that such limited disclosure has previously \\nbeen approved or permitted in drug la-beling conforming to the provisions of §§201.100 or 201.105; and \\n(b) The use of a single term for a \\ngroup of side effects and contraindica-tions (for example, ‘‘blood dyscrasias’’ for disclosure of ‘‘leukopenia,’’ ‘‘agranulocytosis,’’ and ‘‘neutropenia’’) is permitted only to the extent that the use of such a single term in place of disclosure of each specific side effect and contraindication has been pre-viously approved or permitted in drug labeling conforming to the provisions of §§201.100 or 201.105. \\n(4) Substance of information to be in-\\ncluded in brief summary.

An \\nadvertisement does not satisfy the re-quirement that it present a ‘‘true statement’’ of information in brief summary relating to side effects, con-traindications, and effectiveness if: \\n(i) It is false or misleading with re-\\nspect to side effects, contraindications, or effectiveness; or \\n(ii) It fails to present a fair balance \\nbetween information relating to side effects and contraindications and infor-mation relating to effectiveness of the drug in that the information relating to effectiveness is presented in greater scope, depth, or detail than is required by section 502(n) of the act and this in-formation is not fairly balanced by a presentation of a summary of true in-formation relating to side effects and contraindications of the drug; Provided, \\nhowever, That no advertisement shall \\nbe considered to be in violation of this section if the presentation of true in-formation relating to side effects and contraindications is comparable in depth and detail with the claims for ef-fectiveness or safety. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00121 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '107', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(1) An NDC is proposed for as-\\nsignment by FDA when it is submitted for the first time with listing informa-tion in accordance with §207.49 or §207.53, as applicable. \\n(i) Each manufacturer, repacker, or \\nrelabeler must propose for assignment by FDA an NDC that includes its own labeler code for each package size and type of drug that it manufactures, re-packs, or relabels for commercial dis-tribution. \\n(ii) In addition, if a drug is distrib-\\nuted under the trade name or label of a private label distributor, the manufac-turer, repacker, or relabeler must also propose for assignment by FDA an NDC that includes the labeler code of the private label distributor under whose trade name or label the drug is distrib-uted, for each package size and type so distributed. (2) If a proposed NDC conforms to the \\nrequirements of this section and is not reserved for a different drug or was not previously assigned to a different drug, FDA will assign the NDC to a drug when it receives listing information re-quired for that drug under §207.49 or §207.53. \\n(3) A manufacturer, repacker, re-\\nlabeler, or private label distributor may voluntarily reserve a proposed NDC for a drug, before the drug is list-ed, by submitting the following infor-mation: \\n(i) A proposed NDC that conforms to \\nthe requirements of this section; \\n(ii) The established name of the ac-\\ntive ingredient(s) and the strength of each active ingredient in the drug; and \\n(iii) In the case of a finished drug \\nproduct, the dosage form, and route of administration. \\n(4) If the required information is sub-\\nmitted and the proposed NDC is prop-erly formatted and not already as-signed or reserved, FDA will reserve the proposed NDC for a period of 2 years from the date of submission. If the drug for which the proposed NDC is reserved is not listed in accordance with §207.49 or §207.53 during such 2- year period, the reservation of the pro-posed NDC will lapse. FDA may also cancel the reservation of a proposed NDC at any time on the request of the person whose labeler code is included in the proposed NDC. \\n(e) How must the information be sub-\\nmitted to us ? The information described \\nin paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section must be submitted electronically un-less FDA grants a waiver under §207.65. \\n§ 207.35 What changes require a new \\nNDC? \\n(a) Once an NDC has been assigned by \\nFDA, the registrant must propose a new and unique NDC for a drug when there is a change, after the drug is ini-tially marketed, to any of the informa-tion identified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

The Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration has the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \\nAct (the act) to establish a uniform na-tional requirement for tamper-evident packaging of OTC drug products that will improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a der-matological, dentifrice, insulin, or loz-enge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant pack-age or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both. \\n(b) Requirements for tamper-evident \\npackage. (1) Each manufacturer and \\npacker who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, den-tifrice, insulin, or lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-evident package, if this prod-uct is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-evident pack-age is one having one or more indica-tors or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has oc-curred. To reduce the likelihood of suc-cessful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinc-tive by design or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying char-acteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, reg-istered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term ‘‘distinctive by design’’ means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. A tamper-evident package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary-container or car-ton system or any combination of sys-tems intended to provide a visual indi-cation of package integrity. The tam-per-evident feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manu-facture, distribution, and retail dis-play. \\n(2) In addition to the tamper-evident \\npackaging feature described in para-graph (b)(1) of this section, any two- piece, hard gelatin capsule covered by \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00179 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '165', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(1) In order to alert con-\\nsumers to the specific tamper-evident feature(s) used, each retail package of an OTC drug product covered by this section (except ammonia inhalant in crushable glass ampules, containers of compressed medical oxygen, or aerosol products that depend upon the power of a liquefied or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container) is re-quired to bear a statement that: \\n(i) Identifies all tamper-evident fea-\\nture(s) and any capsule sealing tech-nologies used to comply with para-graph (b) of this section; \\n(ii) Is prominently placed on the \\npackage; and \\n(iii) Is so placed that it will be unaf-\\nfected if the tamper-evident feature of the package is breached or missing. \\n(2) If the tamper-evident feature cho-\\nsen to meet the requirements in para-\\ngraph (b) of this section uses an identi-fying characteristic, that char-acteristic is required to be referred to in the labeling statement. For exam-ple, the labeling statement on a bottle with a shrink band could say ‘‘For your protection, this bottle has an im-printed seal around the neck.’’ \\n(d) Request for exemptions from pack-\\naging and labeling requirements. A man-\\nufacturer or packer may request an ex-emption from the packaging and label-ing requirements of this section. A re-quest for an exemption is required to be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under §10.30 of this chapter and should be clearly identified on the envelope as a ‘‘Request for Exemption from the Tamper-Evident Packaging Rule.’’ The petition is required to con-tain the following: \\n(1) The name of the drug product or, \\nif the petition seeks an exemption for a drug class, the name of the drug class, and a list of products within that class. \\n(2) The reasons that the drug prod-\\nuct’s compliance with the tamper-evi-dent packaging or labeling require-ments of this section is unnecessary or cannot be achieved. \\n(3) A description of alternative steps \\nthat are available, or that the peti-tioner has already taken, to reduce the likelihood that the product or drug class will be the subject of malicious \\nadulteration. \\n(4) Other information justifying an \\nexemption. \\n(e) OTC drug products subject to ap-\\nproved new drug applications. Holders of \\napproved new drug applications for OTC drug products are required under §314.70 of this chapter to provide the \\nagency with notification of changes in packaging and labeling to comply with the requirements of this section. Changes in packaging and labeling re-quired by this regulation may be made before FDA approval, as provided under §314.70(c) of this chapter.

You must \\nestablish appropriate written specifica-tions for the identity, quality, and pu-rity of components and for the identity and quality of drug product containers and closures. \\n(c) Examination and testing. Upon re-\\nceipt, each lot of components and con-tainers and closures must be uniquely identified and tested or examined to determine whether the lot complies with your specifications. You must not use in PET drug production any lot that does not meet its specifications, including any expiration date if appli-cable, or that has not yet received its material release. Any incoming lot must be appropriately designated as quarantined, accepted, or rejected. You must use a reliable supplier as a source of each lot of each component, con-tainer, and closure. \\n(1)(i) If you conduct finished-product \\ntesting of a PET drug product that in-cludes testing to ensure that the cor-rect components have been used, you must determine that each lot of incom-ing components used in that PET drug product complies with written speci-fications by examining a certificate of analysis provided by the supplier. You are not required to perform a specific identity test on any of those compo-nents. \\n(ii) If you do not conduct finished- \\nproduct testing of a PET drug product that ensures that the correct compo-nents have been used, you must con-duct identity testing on each lot of a component that yields an active ingre-dient and each lot of an inactive ingre-dient used in that PET drug product. This testing must be conducted using tests that are specific to each compo-nent that yields an active ingredient and each inactive ingredient. For any other component, such as a solvent or reagent, that is not the subject of fin-ished-product testing, you must deter-mine that each lot complies with writ-ten specifications by examining a cer-tificate of analysis provided by the sup-plier; if you use such a component to prepare an inactive ingredient on site, you must perform an identity test on the components used to make the inac-tive ingredient before the components \\nare released for use. However, if you use as an inactive ingredient a product that is approved under section 505 of the act (21 U.S.C. 355) and is marketed as a finished drug product intended for intravenous administration, you need not perform a specific identity test on that ingredient. \\n(2) You must examine a representa-\\ntive sample of each lot of containers and closures for conformity to its writ-ten specifications. You must perform at least a visual identification of each \\nlot of containers and closures. \\n(d) Handling and storage. You must \\nhandle and store components, con-tainers, and closures in a manner that prevents contamination, mix-ups, and deterioration and ensures that they are and remain suitable for their intended use. \\n(e) Records. You must keep a record \\nfor each shipment of each lot of compo-nents, containers, and closures that you receive.

Be-\\nfore final release, you must conduct an appropriate laboratory determination to ensure that each batch of a PET drug product conforms to specifica-tions, except for sterility. For a PET drug product produced in sub-batches, before final release, you must conduct an appropriate laboratory determina-tion to ensure that each sub-batch con-forms to specifications, except for ste-rility. \\n(d) Final release procedures. Except as \\nconditional final release is permitted in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, you must establish and follow procedures to ensure that each batch of a PET drug product is not given final release until the following are done: \\n(1) An appropriate laboratory deter-\\nmination under paragraph (c) of this section is completed; \\n(2) Associated laboratory data and \\ndocumentation are reviewed and they demonstrate that the PET drug prod-uct meets specifications, except for sterility; and \\n(3) A designated qualified individual \\nauthorizes final release by dated signa-ture. \\n(e) Sterility testing. Sterility testing \\nneed not be completed before final re-lease but must be started within 30 hours after completion of production. The 30-hour requirement may be ex-ceeded due to a weekend or holiday. If the sample for sterility testing is held longer than 30 hours, you must dem-onstrate that the longer period does not adversely affect the sample and the test results obtained will be equivalent to test results that would have been obtained if the test had been started within the 30-hour time period. Tested samples must be from individual batches and not pooled. If the product fails to meet a criterion for sterility, you must immediately notify all facili-ties that received the product of the test results and provide any appro-priate recommendations. The notifica-tion must be documented. Upon com-pletion of an investigation into the failure to meet a criterion for sterility, you must notify all facilities that re-ceived the product of the findings from the investigation. \\n(f) Conditional final release. (1) If you \\ncannot complete one of the required finished-product tests for a batch of a \\nPET drug product because of a mal-function involving analytical equip-ment, you may approve the conditional final release of the product if you meet the following conditions: \\n(i) You have data documenting that \\npreceding consecutive batches, pro-duced using the same methods used for the conditionally released batch, dem-onstrate that the conditionally re-leased batch will likely meet the estab-lished specifications; \\n(ii) You determine that all other ac-\\nceptance criteria are met; \\n(iii) You retain a reserve sample of \\nthe conditionally released batch of drug product; \\n(iv) You promptly correct the mal-\\nfunction of analytical equipment, com-plete the omitted test using the reserve sample after the malfunction is cor-rected, and document that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent re-currence of the malfunction; \\n(v) If you obtain an out-of-specifica-\\ntion result when testing the reserve sample, you immediately notify the re-ceiving facility; and \\n(vi) You document all actions regard-\\ning the conditional final release of the drug product, including the justifica-tion for the release, all followup ac-tions, results of completed testing, all notifications, and corrective actions to prevent recurrence of the malfunction involving analytical equipment. \\n(2) Even if the criteria in paragraph \\n(f)(1) of this section are met, you may not approve the conditional final re-lease of the product if the malfunction involving analytical equipment pre-vents the performance of a radiochemical identity/purity test or prevents the determination of the prod-uct’s specific activity. \\n(3) You may not release another \\nbatch of the PET drug product until you have corrected the problem con-cerning the malfunction of analytical equipment and completed the omitted finished-product test. \\n§ 212.71 What actions must I take if a \\nbatch of PET drug product does not conform to specifications? \\n(a) Rejection of nonconforming product. \\nYou must reject a batch of a PET drug \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00196 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '182', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that the administration of such com-binations for said purposes is without medical rationale except possibly in those relatively uncommon instances where the condition is directly related to hypothyroidism and there exists a concurrent need for appetite control (in such instances the safety and effec-tiveness of such combinations are not generally recognized). In particular, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that neither the consensus of in-formed medical opinion nor clinical ex-perience justifies any representation that such combinations are safe and ef-fective in connection with the treat-ment, control, or management of obe-sity in patients having normal thyroid function. \\n(b) Combinations of thyroid or other \\nthyrogenic drugs with central nervous system stimulants with or without other drug substances when offered for or as adjuncts to the treatment, con-trol, or management of obesity not re-lated to hypothyroidism are regarded as misbranded. Such combinations when offered for obesity in humans di-rectly attributable to established hypothyroidism are regarded as new drugs within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n§ 250.12 Stramonium preparations la-\\nbeled with directions for use in self- medication regarded as mis-branded. \\n(a) Stramonium products for inhala-\\ntion have been offered for use in the therapy of the acute attacks of bron-chial asthma for many years although their reliability and effectiveness are questionable. Recently, a significantly increased number of reports have come to the attention of the Food and Drug Administration showing that such products have been subject to abuse and misuse on a fairly large scale, mostly by young people, through oral ingestion for the purpose of producing \\nhallucinations. Reports of such use have been received from physicians and police and other law enforcement au-thorities. Reports have also appeared in the public press and in medical jour-nals. \\n(b) Labeling these products with a \\nwarning that they are not for oral in-gestion has not been effective in pro-tecting the public. Misuse of stramo-nium preparations can cause serious toxic effects including toxic delirium, visual disturbances, fever, and coma. A number of serious reactions have al-ready occurred from the oral ingestion \\nof such products. \\n(c) On the basis of this information, \\nthe Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that such articles have a potentiality for harmful effect through misuse and are not safe for use except under the supervision of a physician.

Addi-tionally, comment included a great deal of concern expressed by individual physicians, medical associations, phar-maceutical associations, manufactur-ers, and State and local health authori-ties. Based on the information avail-able, it is the opinion of the Commis-sioner of Food and Drugs, concurred in by the Food and Drug Administration Medical Advisory Board, that amyl ni-trite inhalant is a drug with a poten-tiality for harmful effect and that it should be removed from over-the- counter status and restricted to sale on the prescription of a practitioner li-censed by law to administer such drug. \\n(b) Therefore, amyl nitrite inhalant \\nwill be regarded as misbranded unless the labeling on or within the package from which the drug is to be dispensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by physicians, in ac-cordance with §201.100(c) of this chap-ter, and its label bears the statement ‘‘Rx only.’’ \\n(c) Regulatory proceedings may be \\ninitiated with regard to the interstate shipment of amyl nitrite inhalant that is labeled, advertised, or dispensed con-trary to this statement of policy if \\nsuch act occurs after July 1, 1969. \\n[40 FR 14033, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 67 \\nFR 4906, Feb. 1, 2002] \\n§ 250.101 Amphetamine and meth-\\namphetamine inhalers regarded as prescription drugs. \\n(a) Recurring reports of abuse and \\nmisuse of methamphetamine (also known as desoxyephedrine) inhalers show that they have a potentiality for harmful effect and that they should not be freely available to the public through over-the-counter sale. From complaints by law-enforcement offi-cials, health officials, individual physi-cians, parents, and others as well as from Food and Drug Administration in-vestigations, it is evident that the wicks from these inhalers are being re-moved and the methamphetamine they contain is being used as a substitute for amphetamine tablets. Amphet-amine tablets and amphetamine inhal-ers have been restricted to prescription sale because of their potentiality for \\nharm to the user. \\n(b) It is the considered opinion of the \\nFood and Drug Administration that, in order to adequately protect the public health, inhalers containing meth-amphetamine or methamphetamine salts (d-desoxyephedrine, or dl-desoxy-ephedrine, or their salts), as well as amphetamine inhalers should be re-stricted to prescription sale and should be labeled with the statement ‘‘Rx only.’’ \\n[40 FR 14033, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 67 \\nFR 4906, Feb. 1, 2002] \\n§ 250.102 Drug preparations intended \\nfor human use containing certain ‘‘coronary vasodilators’’. \\n(a)(1) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion finds that the following ‘‘coronary vasodilators’’ are extensively regarded by physicians as safe and useful as em-\\nployed under medical supervision for the management of angina pectoris in some patients: \\nAmyl nitrite. \\nErythrityl tetranitrate.

Articles for which new-drug approvals are now in effect should be covered by supple-mental new-drug applications as nec-essary to provide for labeling revisions consistent with this policy statement. \\n§§ 250.103–250.104 [Reserved] § 250.105 Gelsemium-containing prep-\\narations regarded as prescription drugs. \\nIt is the consensus of informed med-\\nical opinion that the margin of safety \\nbetween the therapeutic and toxic con-centration of gelsemium is narrow and it is difficult to predict the point at which the dose will be toxic. Very small doses may cause toxic symptoms. It is therefore the view of the Food and Drug Administration that gelsemium is not a proper ingredient in any prod-uct that is to be sold without prescrip-tion. Accordingly, any drug containing gelsemium will be regarded as mis-branded under section 503(b)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act if its label fails to bear in a prominent and conspicuous fashion the statement ‘‘Rx only.’’ \\n[40 FR 14033, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 67 \\nFR 4906, Feb. 1, 2002] §§ 250.106–250.107 [Reserved] \\n§ 250.108 Potassium permanganate \\npreparations as prescription drugs. \\n(a) There have been a number of re-\\nports in the medical literature of seri-ous injuries to women resulting from the misuse of potassium permanganate in an effort to induce abortion. Reports from physicians who have treated such cases show that the injuries are com-monly caused by introducing tablets or crystals of potassium permanganate into the vagina. Experience with these cases shows that such use of potassium permanganate is not effective in pro-ducing abortion, but that instead the drug produces serious and painful in-jury to the walls of the vagina, causing ulcers, massive hemorrhage, and infec-tion. Such dangerous and useless em-ployment of potassium permanganate is apparently encouraged among the misinformed by the mistaken idea that the vaginal bleeding caused by the cor-rosive action of the drug indicates a termination of pregnancy, which it does not. \\n(b) Potassium permanganate is a \\nstrong oxidizing agent, a highly caus-tic, tissue-destroying chemical, and a poison. There are no circumstances under which crystals and tablets of po-tassium permanganate constitute safe dosage forms for use in self-medica-tion. It is the consensus of informed medical opinion that the only dosage forms of potassium permanganate known to be safe for use in self-medica-tion are aqueous solutions containing not more than 0.04 percent potassium permanganate. Such solutions are safe for use in self-medication only by ex-ternal application to the skin. \\n(c) In view of the very real poten-\\ntiality for harmful effect, and the ac-tual injuries caused by the misuse of potassium permanganate, the Food and Drug Administration believes that in order adequately to protect the public health: \\n(1) Potassium permanganate and po-\\ntassium permanganate tablets intended for human use are drugs subject to sec-tion 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and should be restricted to prescription sale.

It clearly presents the following facts: \\n(1) The Sixteenth Revision of the \\nPharmacopeia of the United States, which became official on October 1, 1960, does not include preparations in-tended for the treatment of pernicious anemia by oral administration. \\n(2) The U.S.P. unit for anti-anemia \\npreparations no longer has any signifi-cance. \\n(3) The U.S.P.

Anti-ane-mia Preparations Advisory Board as well as pertinent information from other sources, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds it is the con-sensus of well informed medical opin-ion that: \\n(1) The parenteral administration of \\ncyanocobalamin or vitamin B\\n12is gen-\\nerally recognized as a fully effective treatment of pernicious anemia. Paren-teral cyanocobalamin preparations have not been and are not authorized for use except by or on the prescription of a duly licensed medical practitioner. \\n(2) Some patients afflicted with per-\\nnicious anemia do not respond to oral-ly ingested products. There is no known way to predict which patients will fail to respond or will cease to re-spond to the treatment of pernicious \\nanemia with orally ingested prepara-tions. \\n(3) The substitution of a possibly in-\\nadequate treatment, such as the inges-tion of oral preparations of vitamin B\\n12 \\nwith intrinsic factor concentrate, in place of parenteral vitamin B\\n12prod-\\nucts for a disease condition as serious \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00216 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '202', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Pernicious anemia is a disease that is associated, among other things, with a higher than normal incidence of cancer of the stomach and that for the safety of the patient, requires continuous ex-pert medical supervision. \\n(5) With inadequate treatment there \\nmay be markedly deleterious effects on the nervous system. It is well estab-lished that whereas the development of anemia is completely reversible with adequate treatment, the involvement of the nervous system may not be com-pletely reversible and thus may result in permanent damage. \\n(6) Some hematologists prescribe oral \\npreparations of vitamin B\\n12in the \\ntreatment of pernicious-anemia pa-tients. \\n(7) Intrinsic factor and intrinsic fac-\\ntor concentrate serve no known useful therapeutic or nutritive purpose except to the extent that they do increase the gastrointestinal absorption of vitamin B\\n12in patients with a deficiency or ab-\\nsence of intrinsic factor, which may eventually lead to pernicious anemia. This conclusion does not apply to diag-nostic procedures using radioactive cyanocobalamin. \\n(8) Medical expertise is required for \\nthe diagnosis as well as the manage-ment of pernicious anemia. \\n(c) The Eleventh Edition of The Na-\\ntional Formulary and its first Interim Revision include monographs for oral preparations of vitamin B\\n12with in-\\ntrinsic factor concentrate, establish a unit of vitamin B\\n12with intrinsic fac-\\ntor concentrate, and provide for a Na-tional Formulary Anti-anemia Prep-arations Advisory Board to assign the potency of such preparations. This pro-vides for the availability of such oral preparations, standardized within the meaning of the broad limits char-acteristic of the evaluation of such preparations. \\n(d) Any drug that is offered for or \\npurports to contain intrinsic factor or intrinsic factor concentrate will be re-garded as misbranded within the mean-ing of section 503(b) of the Federal \\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless it is labeled with the statement ‘‘Rx only.’’ \\n(e) Any drug for oral ingestion in-\\ntended, represented, or advertised for the prevention or treatment of per-nicious anemia or which purports to contain any substance or mixture of substances described in paragraph (d) of this section (other than diagnostic drugs containing radioactive cyano-cobalamin) will be regarded as mis-branded under sections 502 (f)(2) and (j) of the act unless its labeling bears a statement to the effect that some pa-tients afflicted with pernicious anemia may not respond to the orally ingested product and that there is no known way to predict which patients will re-spond or which patients may cease to respond to the orally ingested prod-ucts. The labeling shall also bear a statement that periodic examinations and laboratory studies of pernicious anemia patients are essential and rec-ommended. \\n(f) Under section 409 of the Federal \\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, intrin-sic factor and intrinsic factor con-centrate are regarded as food additives. No food additive regulation nor exist-ing extension of the effective date of section 409 of the act authorizes these additives in foods, including foods for special dietary uses.

It is used in such products be-cause of its bacteriostatic action against gram-positive organisms, espe-cially against strains of staphy-lococcus; however, hexachlorophene of-fers no protection against gram-nega-tive infections. In addition the anti-bacterial activity depends largely on repeated use. A notice published in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER of April 4, 1972 (37 \\nFR 6775), invited data on OTC anti-microbial ingredients, including hexachlorophene, for review by an OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel to be con-vened under the procedures set forth in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER of May 11, 1972 \\n(37 FR 9464). This statement of policy will remain in effect unless and until replaced by a monograph resulting from the OTC Drug Advisory Review Panel. \\n(b) Adverse effects. Though considered \\nsafe for many years, recent informa-tion has become available associating hexachlorophene with toxic effects, in-cluding deaths. Studies have shown that toxic amounts of hexachlorophene can be absorbed through the skin of hu-mans, especially the skin of premature babies or damaged skin. Human tox-icity reports include data on symp-tomatology, blood and tissue levels of hexachlorophene, and descriptions of neuropathologic lesions. Recent infant deaths due to use of baby powder acci-dentally contaminated with 6 percent hexachlorophene have occurred. The accumulated evidence of toxicity is sufficient to require that continued marketing of hexachlorophene con-taining products be carefully defined in order to protect consumers. \\n(c) Prescription drugs. (1) Because of \\ntheir potential for harmful effect, drugs containing hexachlorophene, other than as a preservative as de-scribed below, are not considered to have been shown to be safe and effec-tive, are regarded as new drugs requir-ing approved new drug applications, and would be misbranded for over-the- counter distribution. In the interest of public health protection, hexachlorophene containing drugs will be regarded as misbranded and subject to regulatory proceedings unless the label bears the statement ‘‘Rx only,’’ and the labeling on or within the pack-\\nage from which the drug is to be dis-pensed bears adequate information for its safe and effective use by practi-tioners, in accord with §201.100(c) of this chapter. \\n(2) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion recognizes that hexachlorophene is useful as a bacteriostatic skin cleanser. It further concludes that the margin of safety is such that products containing hexachlorophene may ap-propriately be used within clearly de-lineated conditions of use. \\n(3) In order for such drugs to bear \\nadequate information for safe and ef-fective use the following statements are representative of the type of label-ing for products shown to be effective bacteriostatic skin cleansers. Labeling for products other than bacteriostatic skin cleansers will be determined through the new drug procedures based on the available data. \\n(i) In the labeling other than on the \\nimmediate container label. \\nINDICATIONS  \\n1.

Not for routine prophylactic total body \\nbathing. \\nWARNINGS  \\nRinse thoroughly after use. Patients \\nshould be closely monitored and use should be immediately discontinued at the first sign of any of the symptoms described below. \\nHexachlorophene is rapidly absorbed and \\nmay produce toxic blood levels when applied to skin lesions such as ichthyosis congenita or the dermatitis of Letterer-Siwe’s syn-drome or other generalized dermatologic conditions. Application to burns has also produced neurotoxicity and death. \\nInfants have developed dermatitis, irrita-\\nbility, generalized clonic muscular contrac-tions and decerebrate rigidity following ap-plication of a 6 percent hexachlorophene powder.

Such use of hexachlorophene shall be limited to situations where an alternative preservative has not yet been shown to be as effective or where adequate integrity and stability data for the reformulated product are not yet available. This use of hexachlorophene will not, by itself, re-quire an approved new drug applica-tion. Use of hexachlorophene as a pre-servative at a level higher than 0.1 per-cent is regarded as a new drug use re-quiring an approved new drug applica-tion, which must be submitted within the time set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. \\n(e) Cosmetics. Hexachlorophene may \\nbe used as a preservative in cosmetic products other than those which in normal use may be applied to mucous membranes or which are intended to be used on mucous membranes, at a level that is no higher than necessary to achieve the intended preservative func-tion, and in no event higher than 0.1 percent. Such use of hexachlorophene shall be limited to situations where an alternative preservative has not yet been shown to be as effective or where adequate integrity and stability data for the reformulated product are not yet available. The component of a pre-servative system whether hexachlorophene or other anti-microbial agent, should be selected on the basis of the effect on the total mi-crobial ecology of the product, not merely on gram-positive bacteria. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00219 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '205', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

      "page_content='213 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 251.2 \\npart, the Secretary may determine, \\nbased on experience under the program, that there is a sufficient likelihood that a proposal that does not include a State or Indian Tribe as the SIP spon-sor could provide the same level of as-surance of safety as a proposal that does include such a sponsor, such that FDA may begin receiving, reviewing, and potentially authorizing applica-tions for SIPs without such a sponsor. After the Secretary makes such a de-termination, a pharmacist or whole-saler may propose a SIP that does not include a State or Indian Tribe as a sponsor, and FDA may authorize such a SIP if the sponsor demonstrates that the SIP meets the criteria for author-ization with the same level of assur-ance of safety as a proposal that in-cludes a State or Indian Tribe as the SIP sponsor, which FDA shall evaluate consistent with any considerations de-scribed in the Secretary’s determina-tion, including by evaluating whether the application demonstrates that the proposed sponsor has sufficient rel-evant experience, such as participating in a SIP and demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and this part. \\nSection 804 Importation Program Co- \\nSponsor (‘‘SIP Co-Sponsor’’) means any \\nother State or Indian Tribe, or a phar-macist or a wholesale distributor that, with the SIP Sponsor, signs a proposal to FDA that describes a program to fa-cilitate the importation of prescription drugs from Canada under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\nSection 804 Serial Identifier (‘‘SSI’’) \\nmeans a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters that is assigned and placed on or affixed by the Foreign Seller to each package and homogenous case of the product that the Foreign Seller intends to sell to an Importer. For purposes of the SSI, ‘‘package’’ means the smallest indi-vidual saleable unit of product for dis-tribution that is intended by the For-eign Seller for sale to an Importer lo-cated in the United States, and ‘‘indi-vidual saleable unit’’ means the small-est container of product sold by the Foreign Seller to the Importer. \\nSerious adverse event means: (1) An adverse event is considered \\n‘‘serious’’ if it results in any of the fol-lowing outcomes: \\n(i) Death; (ii) A life-threatening adverse event; (iii) Inpatient hospitalization or pro-\\nlongation of existing hospitalization; \\n(iv) A persistent or significant inca-\\npacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life func-tions; and/or \\n(v) A congenital anomaly/birth de-\\nfect. \\n(2) Other events that may be consid-\\nered serious adverse events: Important medical events that may not result in one of the listed outcomes in this defi-nition may be considered serious ad-verse events when, based upon appro-priate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or study subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the out-comes listed in this definition. Exam-ples include: Allergic bronchospasm re-quiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of product depend-ency or product abuse. \\nStatutory Testing means the testing of \\nan eligible prescription drug as re-quired by section 804(d)(1)(J) and (L) and section 804(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including for authenticity, for degradation, and to ensure that the prescription drug is in compliance with established specifica-tions and standards. \\nSuspect foreign product means a drug \\npurchased by a Foreign Seller from a manufacturer, and intended for sale to an Importer in the United States, for which the Foreign Seller has reason to believe that such product: \\n(1) Is potentially counterfeit, di-\\nverted, or stolen; \\n(2) Is potentially intentionally adul-\\nterated such that the product would re-sult in serious adverse health con-sequences or death to humans; \\n(3) Is potentially the subject of a \\nfraudulent transaction; or \\n(4) Appears otherwise unfit for dis-\\ntribution such that the product would result in serious adverse health con-sequences or death to humans. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00223 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '209', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='214 21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–22 Edition) § 251.3 \\nTransaction means the transfer of \\nproduct between persons in which a change of ownership occurs, in accord-ance with section 581(24) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For the purposes of this part, ‘‘transaction’’ in-cludes the sale and transfer of product between the manufacturer and Foreign Seller. The sale and transfer of product between Foreign Seller and Importer also constitutes a ‘‘transaction.’’ \\nUnexpected adverse event means an ad-\\nverse event that is not included in the current U.S. labeling for the drug prod-uct. Events that may be sympto-matically or pathophysiologically re-lated to an adverse event included in the labeling but differ from the labeled event because of greater severity or specificity would be considered unex-pected. ‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events that are mentioned in the product la-beling as occurring with a class of products or anticipated from the phar-macological properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product. \\n(1) Example of greater severity. Under \\nthis definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the labeling referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. \\n(2) Example of greater specificity. Cere-\\nbral thromboembolism and cerebral hemorrhage would be unexpected if the labeling included only cerebrovascular accidents. \\nUnique facility identifier means the \\nidentifier required to be submitted by the registrant for drug establishment registration under section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in accordance with §207.25 of this chap-ter. For Foreign Sellers registering under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the term ‘‘unique facility identifier’’ means the identifier required to be submitted under §251.9 in accordance with the system specified under section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\nWholesaler means a person licensed as \\na wholesale distributor, as the terms ‘‘licensed’’ and ‘‘wholesale distributor’’ are defined in section 581(9)(A) and 581(29), respectively. The term ‘‘whole-saler’’ does not include a person au-thorized to import drugs under section \\n801(d)(1). \\nSubpart B—Section 804 Importa-\\ntion Program Proposals and Pre-Import Requests \\n§ 251.3 SIP proposal submission re-\\nquirements. \\n(a) A SIP Sponsor may delegate im-\\nplementation activities to a SIP co- sponsor but the SIP Sponsor remains responsible for oversight of the imple-mentation of the program. \\n(b) A SIP Sponsor must only des-\\nignate one Foreign Seller and one Im-porter per initial proposal. Additional Foreign Sellers and Importers may be added to an authorized SIP through a supplemental proposal under §251.8. \\n(c) A SIP Sponsor that intends to im-\\nplement a SIP under this part must submit a proposal to FDA in electronic format via FDA’s Electronic Submis-sions Gateway (ESG) or to an alter-native transmission point identified by FDA. The proposal must include: \\n(1) A cover sheet containing the fol-\\nlowing: \\n(i) Name or names of SIP Sponsor \\nand co-sponsors, if any; \\n(ii) Name and contact information \\nfor a person authorized to serve as the point of contact with FDA during its review of the proposal; and \\n(iii) The signature of the SIP Sponsor \\nand co-sponsors, if any, or authorized representative who is an employee or agent of the Sponsor or co-sponsor and has been authorized to sign the pro-posal for the Sponsor or co-sponsor.

FDA may use a phased review process to re-view a SIP Proposal that does not iden-tify a Foreign Seller in an initial sub-mission, under which FDA may notify the Sponsor of such a SIP Proposal whether the Sponsor’s SIP Proposal otherwise meets the requirements of this part. In such a case, the required information regarding importers, re-labelers, and repackagers still must be included in the initial submission of the SIP Proposal, and the SIP Proposal will be denied if a Foreign Seller is not identified within 6 months of the ini-tial submission date of the SIP Pro-posal. \\n(a) FDA may deny a request for au-\\nthorization, modification, or extension of a SIP, including if a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal does not meet the requirements of this part. When a SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal meets the requirements of this part, FDA may nonetheless decide not to au-thorize the SIP Proposal or supple-mental proposal. For example, FDA may decide not to authorize a SIP Pro-posal or supplemental proposal because of potential safety concerns with the SIP; because a Foreign Seller is not identified within 6 months of the ini-tial submission of the SIP Proposal; be-cause of the degree of uncertainty that the SIP Proposal or supplemental pro-posal would adequately ensure the pro-tection of public health; because of, based on the recommendation of an-other Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) component as \\ndirected by the Secretary, the relative likelihood that the SIP Proposal or supplemental proposal would not result in significant cost savings to the Amer-ican consumer; because of the potential for conflicts of interest; or in order to limit the number of authorized SIPs so FDA can effectively and efficiently carry out its responsibilities under sec-tion 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in light of the amount of \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00227 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '213', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

L. 87–781) authorizes the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to designate an official name for any drug if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity. Section 502(e) of the act (as amended by said Drug Amendments) prescribes that the labeling of a drug must bear its estab-lished name, if there is one, to the ex-clusion of any other nonproprietary name (except the applicable systematic chemical name or the chemical for-mula) and, if the drug is fabricated from two or more ingredients, the es-tablished name of each active ingre-dient. \\n(b) The term established name is de-\\nfined in section 502(e)(3) of the act as (1) an official name designated pursu-ant to section 508 of the act; (2) if no such official name has been designated for the drug and the drug is an article recognized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium; and (3) if neither para-graphs (b) (1) or (2) of this section ap-plies, then the common or usual name of the drug. \\n(c) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion recognizes the skill and experience of the U.S. Adopted Names Council (USAN) in deriving names for drugs. The U.S. Adopted Names Council is a private organization sponsored by the American Medical Association, the United States Pharmacopeia, and the American Pharmaceutical Association, and has been engaged in the assign-ment of names to drugs since January 1964. The Council negotiates with man-ufacturing firms in the selection of nonproprietary names for drugs. \\n(d) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion cooperates with and is represented on the USAN Council. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration agrees with ‘‘Guiding Principles for Coining U.S. Adopted Names for Drugs,’’ pub-lished in USAN and the USP Dictionary \\nof Drug Names (USAN 1985 ed., 1961–1984 \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 14:21 Nov 14, 2022 Jkt 256074 PO 00000 Frm 00246 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256074.XXX 256074rmajette on DSKB3F4F33PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol4-chapI-subchapC.pdf', 'page': '232', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

All applicants for \\nnew-drug applications and sponsors for ‘‘Investigational New Drug Applica-tions’’ (IND’s) are encouraged to con-tact the USAN Council for assistance in selection of a simple and useful name for a new chemical entity. Ap-proval of a new-drug application pro-viding for the use of a new drug sub-stance may be delayed if a simple and useful nonproprietary name does not exist for the substance and if one is not proposed in the application that meets the above-cited guidelines. Prior use of a name in the medical literature or otherwise will not commit the Food and Drug Administration to adopting such terminology as official. \\n(e) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion will not routinely designate offi-cial names under section 508 of the act. As a result, the established name under section 502(e) of the act will ordinarily be either the compendial name of the drug or, if there is no compendial name, the common and usual name of the drug. Interested persons, in the ab-sence of the designation by the food and Drug Administration of an official name, may rely on as the established name for any drug the current compendial name or the USAN adopted name listed in USAN and the USP Dic-\\ntionary of Drug Names. The Food and \\nDrug Administration, however, will continue to publish official names under the provisions of section 508 of \\nthe act when the agency determines that: \\n(1) The USAN or other official or \\ncommon or usual name is unduly com-plex or is not useful for any other rea-\\nson; \\n(2) Two or more official names have \\nbeen applied to a single drug, or to two or more drugs that are identical in chemical structure and pharma-cological action and that are substan-tially identical in strength, quality, \\nand purity; or \\n(3) No USAN or other official or com-\\nmon or usual name has been applied to a medically useful drug. Any official name published under section 508 of the act will be the established name of the drug. \\n(f) A cumulative list of U.S. adopted \\nnames selected and released since June 15, 1961, is published yearly by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., in USAN and the USP Dictionary of Drug Names.

The specific products listed in these notices include only those that were introduced into the market through the new drug procedures from 1938–62 and were submitted for review by the National Academy of Sciences- National Research Council (NAS-NRC), Drug Efficacy Study Group. Many products which are identical to, related to, or similar to the products listed in these notices have been marketed under different names or by different firms during this same period or since 1962 without going through the new drug procedures or the Academy re-view. Even though these products are not listed in the notices, they are cov-ered by the new drug applications re-viewed and thus are subject to these notices. All persons with an interest in a product that is identical, related, or similar to a drug listed in a drug effi-cacy notice or a notice of opportunity for a hearing will be given the same op-portunity as the applicant to submit data and information, to request a hearing, and to participate in any hear-ing. It is not feasible for the Food and Drug Administration to list all prod-ucts which are covered by an NDA and thus subject to each notice. However, it is essential that the findings and conclusions that a drug product is a ‘‘new drug’’ or that there is a lack of evidence to show that a drug product is safe or effective be applied to all iden-tical, related, and similar drug prod-ucts to which they are reasonably ap-plicable. Any product not in compli-ance with an applicable drug efficacy notice is in violation of section 505 (new drugs) and/or section 502 (mis-\\nbranding) of the act. \\n(b)(1) An identical, related, or similar \\ndrug includes other brands, potencies, dosage forms, salts, and esters of the same drug moiety as well as of any drug moiety related in chemical struc-ture or known pharmacological prop-erties. \\n(2) Where experts qualified by sci-\\nentific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drugs would conclude that the findings and conclusions, stated in a drug effi-cacy notice or notice of opportunity for hearing, that a drug product is a ‘‘new drug’’ or that there is a lack of evi-dence to show that a drug product is safe or effective are applicable to an identical, related, or similar drug prod-uct, such product is affected by the no-tice. A combination drug product con-taining a drug that is identical, re-lated, or similar to a drug named in a notice may also be subject to the find-ings and conclusions in a notice that a drug product is a ‘‘new drug’’ or that there is a lack of evidence to show that a drug product is safe or effective. \\n(3) Any person may request an opin-\\nion on the applicability of such a no-tice to a specific product by writing to the Food and Drug Administration at the address shown in paragraph (e) of this section. \\n(c) Manufacturers and distributors of \\ndrugs should review their products as drug efficacy notices are published and assure that identical, related, or simi-lar products comply with all applicable provisions of the notices. \\n(d) The published notices and sum-\\nmary lists of the conclusions are of particular interest to drug purchasing \\nagents. These agents should take par-ticular care to assure that the same purchasing policy applies to drug prod-ucts that are identical, related, or similar to those named in the drug effi-cacy notices. The Food and Drug Ad-ministration applies the same regu-latory policy to all such products. In many instances a determination can readily be made as to the applicability of a drug efficacy notice by an indi-vidual who is knowledgeable about drugs and their indications for use. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '4', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Appropriate action, including referral to purchasing offi-cials of various government agencies, will be taken. \\n(f) This regulation does not apply to \\nOTC drugs identical, similar, or related to a drug in the Drug Efficacy Study unless there has been or is notification in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER that a drug \\nwill not be subject to an OTC panel re-view pursuant to §§330.10, 330.11, and 330.5 of this chapter. \\n[39 FR 11680, Mar. 29, 1974, as amended at 48 \\nFR 2755, Jan. 21, 1983; 50 FR 8996, Mar. 6, 1985; \\n55 FR 11578, Mar. 29, 1990; 74 FR 13113, Mar. 26, 2009] \\nSubpart B—Specific Administrative \\nRulings and Decisions \\n§ 310.100 New drug status opinions; \\nstatement of policy. \\n(a) Over the years since 1938 the Food \\nand Drug Administration has given in-formal advice to inquirers as to the new drug status of preparations. These drugs have sometimes been identified only by general statements of composi-tion. Generally, such informal opinions were incorporated in letters that did not explicitly relate all of the nec-essary conditions and qualifications such as the quantitative formula for the drug and the conditions under which it was prescribed, recommended, or suggested. This has contributed to misunderstanding and misinterpreta-tion of such opinions. \\n(b) These informal opinions that an \\narticle is ‘‘not a new drug’’ or ‘‘no longer a new drug’’ require reexamina-tion under the Kefauver-Harris Act (Public Law 87–781; 76 Stat. 788–89). In particular, when approval of a new \\ndrug application is withdrawn under provisions of section 505(e) of the Fed-eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a drug generally recognized as safe may become a ‘‘new drug’’ within the mean-ing of section 201(p) of said act as amended by the Kefauver-Harris Act on October 10, 1962. This is of special im-portance by reason of proposed actions to withdraw approval of new drug ap-plications for lack of substantial evi-dence of effectiveness as a result of re-ports of the National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council on its review of drug effectiveness; for example, see the notice published in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER of January 23, \\n1968 (33 FR 818), regarding rutin, quer-cetin, et al. \\n(c) Any marketed drug is a ‘‘new \\ndrug’’ if any labeling change made after October 9, 1962, recommends or suggests new conditions of use under which the drug is not generally recog-nized as safe and effective by qualified experts. Undisclosed or unreported side effects as well as the emergence of new knowledge presenting questions with respect to the safety or effectiveness of a drug may result in its becoming a ‘‘new drug’’ even though it was pre-viously considered ‘‘not a new drug.’’ Any previously given informal advice that an article is ‘‘not a new drug’’ does not apply to such an article if it has been changed in formulation, man-ufacture control, or labeling in a way that may significantly affect the safety of the drug. \\n(d) For these reasons, all opinions \\npreviously given by the Food and Drug Administration to the effect that an article is ‘‘not a new drug’’ or is ‘‘no longer a new drug’’ are hereby revoked. This does not mean that all articles that were the subjects of such prior opinions will be regarded as new drugs. The prior opinions will be replaced by opinions of the Food and Drug Admin-istration that are qualified and current on when an article is ‘‘not a new drug,’’ as set forth in this subchapter. \\n[39 FR 11680, Mar. 29, 1974] \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '5', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(4) The quantity shipped is limited to \\nan amount reasonable for the purpose of patch testing in the normal course of the practice of medicine and is used solely for such patch testing. \\n(5) The new drug substance is manu-\\nfactured by the same procedures and meets the same specifications as the component used in the finished dosage form. \\n(6) The manufacturer or distributor \\nmaintains records of all shipments for this purpose for a period of 2 years after shipment and will make them available to the Food and Drug Admin-istration on request. \\n(b) When the requested new drug sub-\\nstance is intended for investigational use in humans or the substance is le-gally available only under the inves-tigational drug provisions of part 312 of this chapter, the submission of an ‘‘In-vestigational New Drug Application’’ (IND) is required. The Food and Drug Administration will offer assistance to any practitioner wishing to submit an Investigational New Drug Application.

A proposal to exempt a drug from the prescription-dispensing re-quirements of section 503(b)(1)(B) of the act may be initiated by the Commis-sioner or by any interested person. Any interested person may file a petition seeking such exemption, which petition may be pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, or in the form of a supplement to an approved new drug application. \\n(c) New drug status of drugs exempted \\nfrom the prescription requirement. A drug \\nexempted from the prescription re-quirement under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section is a ‘‘new drug’’ within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act until it has been used to a material extent and for a material time under such conditions except as provided in paragraph (e) of this sec-tion. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '6', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

      "page_content='18 21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–21 Edition) § 310.305 \\nthe reporting requirements of para-\\ngraph (c) of this section must also de-velop written procedures for the sur-veillance, receipt, evaluation, and re-porting of postmarketing adverse drug experiences to FDA. \\n(b) Definitions. The following defini-\\ntions of terms apply to this section: \\nAdverse drug experience. Any adverse \\nevent associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, including the following: An adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from drug overdose whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from drug abuse; an adverse event occurring from drug withdrawal; and any failure of expected pharmacological action. \\nDisability. A substantial disruption of \\na person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. \\nIndividual case safety report (ICSR). A \\ndescription of an adverse drug experi-ence related to an individual patient or subject. \\nICSR attachments. Documents related \\nto the adverse drug experience de-scribed in an ICSR, such as medical records, hospital discharge summaries, or other documentation. \\nLife-threatening adverse drug experi-\\nence. Any adverse drug experience that \\nplaces the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of \\ndeath from the adverse drug experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include \\nan adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. \\nSerious adverse drug experience. Any \\nadverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the fol-lowing outcomes: Death, a life-threat-ening adverse drug experience, inpa-tient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Im-portant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be consid-ered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the pa-tient or subject and may require med-ical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defi-\\nnition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \\nUnexpected adverse drug experience. \\nAny adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differ from the event because of greater se-verity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thrombo-embolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. ‘‘Unex-pected,’’ as used in this definition, re-fers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed ( i.e., \\nincluded in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharma-cological properties of the pharma-ceutical product. \\n(c) Reporting requirements. Each per-\\nson identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must submit to FDA ad-verse drug experience information as described in this section. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this sec-tion, 15-day ‘‘Alert reports’’ and fol-lowup reports, including ICSRs and any ICSR attachments, must be submitted to the Agency in electronic format as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. \\n(1) Postmarketing 15-day ‘‘Alert re-\\nports’’. (i) Any person whose name ap-\\npears on the label of a marketed pre-scription drug product as its manufac-turer, packer, or distributor must re-port to FDA each adverse drug experi-ence received or otherwise obtained that is both serious and unexpected as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the person whose name appears on the label.

Each person identified \\nin paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section must promptly investigate all serious, unexpected adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these post-marketing 15-day Alert reports and must submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new infor-mation or as requested by FDA. If addi-tional information is not obtainable, records should be maintained of the un-successful steps taken to seek addi-tional information. \\n(3) Submission of reports. To avoid un-\\nnecessary duplication in the submis-sion of, and followup to, reports re-quired in this section, a packer’s or dis-tributor’s obligations may be met by submission of all reports of serious ad-verse drug experiences to the manufac-turer of the drug product. If a packer or distributor elects to submit these adverse drug experience reports to the manufacturer rather than to FDA, it must submit, by any appropriate means, each report to the manufac-turer within 5 calendar days of its re-ceipt by the packer or distributor, and the manufacturer must then comply with the requirements of this section even if its name does not appear on the label of the drug product.

Accordingly, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each estrogen drug product restricted to prescription distribution, including products containing estrogens in fixed combinations with other drugs, shall be dispensed to patients with a patient package insert containing information concerning the drug’s benefits and risks. An estrogen drug product that does not comply with the requirements of this section is misbranded under sec-tion 502(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n(b) Distribution requirements.

The Food and Drug Administration has concluded that this \\nreported association provides adequate basis for a warning in the labeling. In view of the similarities in chemical structure and mode of action, the Food and Drug Administration also believes it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that the possible increased risk of cardiovascular mortality from tolbutamide applies to all other sulfo-nylurea drugs as well. Therefore, the labeling for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea class shall include a warning concerning the possible in-creased risk of cardiovascular mor-tality associated with such use, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. \\n(b) Labeling for oral hypoglycemic \\ndrugs of the sulfonylurea class shall in-clude in boldface type at the beginning of the ‘‘Warnings’’ section of the label-ing the following statement: \\nSPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF  \\nCARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY  \\nThe administration of oral hypoglycemic \\ndrugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term pro-spective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complica-\\ntions in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups ( Diabetes, 19 (supp. 2): 747– \\n830, 1970). \\nUGDP reported that patients treated for 5 \\nto 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tol-butamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2\\n1⁄2 \\ntimes that of patients treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mor-tality was not observed, but the use of tol-butamide was discontinued based on the in-crease in cardiovascular mortality, thus lim-iting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be informed of the poten-tial risks and advantages of (name of drug) and of alternative modes of therapy. \\nAlthough only one drug in the sulfonylurea \\nclass (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00037 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '23', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Estrogens, pro-gesterone, pregnenolone, and pregneno-lone acetate have been present as in-gredients in OTC drug products mar-keted for topical use as hormone creams. However, there is a lack of adequate data to establish effective-ness for any OTC drug use of these in-gredients. Therefore, with the excep-tion of those hormones identified in paragraph (e) of this section, any OTC drug product containing an ingredient offered for use as a topically applied hormone cannot be considered gen-erally recognized as safe and effective for its intended use. The intended use of the product may be inferred from the product’s labeling, promotional material, advertising, and any other relevant factor. The use of the word ‘‘hormone’’ in the text of the labeling or in the ingredient statement is an implied drug claim.

There is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of these or any other ingredients for OTC use in relieving the symptoms of benign pros-tatic hypertrophy. In addition, there is no definitive evidence that any drug product offered for the relief of the symptoms of benign prostatic hyper-trophy would alter the obstructive or inflammatory signs and symptoms of this condition. Therefore, self-medica-tion with OTC drug products might un-necessarily delay diagnosis and treat-ment of progressive obstruction and secondary infections.

Anticho-linergic drugs have been marketed OTC in cough-cold drug products to relieve excessive secretions of the nose and eyes, symptoms that are commonly as-sociated with hay fever, allergy, rhi-nitis, and the common cold.

Significant differences have been shown in the bioavailability of mar-keted exocrine pancreatic insufficiency drug products produced by different manufacturers. These differences raise a potential for serious risk to patients using these drug products. The bio-availability of pancreatic enzymes is dependent on the process used to man-ufacture the drug products. Informa-tion on this process is not included in an OTC drug monograph. Therefore, the safe and effective use of these en-zymes for treating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency cannot be regulated ade-quately by an OTC drug monograph.

For the purposes of this part, an experi-ment is any use of a drug except for the use of a marketed drug in the course of medical practice. \\nContract research organization means a \\nperson that assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or monitoring of investigations, evalua-tion of reports, and preparation of ma-terials to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. \\nFDA means the Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration. \\nIND means an investigational new \\ndrug application. For purposes of this part, ‘‘IND’’ is synonymous with ‘‘No-tice of Claimed Investigational Exemp-tion for a New Drug.’’ \\nIndependent ethics committee (IEC) \\nmeans a review panel that is respon-sible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and well-being of human subjects involved in a clinical inves-tigation and is adequately constituted to provide assurance of that protec-tion. An institutional review board (IRB), as defined in §56.102(g) of this chapter and subject to the require-ments of part 56 of this chapter, is one type of IEC. \\nInvestigational new drug means a new \\ndrug or biological drug that is used in a clinical investigation. The term also includes a biological product that is used in vitro for diagnostic purposes. The terms ‘‘investigational drug’’ and ‘‘investigational new drug’’ are deemed to be synonymous for purposes of this part. \\nInvestigator means an individual who \\nactually conducts a clinical investiga-tion ( i.e., under whose immediate direc-\\ntion the drug is administered or dis-pensed to a subject).

The sponsor may be an individual or pharmaceutical company, governmental agency, academic insti-tution, private organization, or other organization. The sponsor does not ac-tually conduct the investigation unless the sponsor is a sponsor-investigator. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a sponsor-in-vestigator, and the employees are in-vestigators. \\nSponsor-Investigator means an indi-\\nvidual who both initiates and conducts an investigation, and under whose im-mediate direction the investigational drug is administered or dispensed. The term does not include any person other than an individual. The requirements applicable to a sponsor-investigator under this part include both those ap-plicable to an investigator and a spon-sor. \\nSubject means a human who partici-\\npates in an investigation, either as a recipient of the investigational new drug or as a control. A subject may be a healthy human or a patient with a disease. \\n[52 FR 8831, Mar. 19, 1987, as amended at 64 \\nFR 401, Jan. 5, 1999; 64 FR 56449, Oct. 20, 1999; 73 FR 22815, Apr. 28, 2008] \\n§ 312.6 Labeling of an investigational \\nnew drug. \\n(a) The immediate package of an in-\\nvestigational new drug intended for human use shall bear a label with the statement ‘‘Caution: New Drug—Lim-ited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.’’ \\n(b) The label or labeling of an inves-\\ntigational new drug shall not bear any statement that is false or misleading in any particular and shall not represent that the investigational new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for \\nwhich it is being investigated. \\n(c) The appropriate FDA Center Di-\\nrector, according to the procedures set forth in §§201.26 or 610.68 of this chap-ter, may grant an exception or alter-native to the provision in paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent that this provision is not explicitly required by statute, for specified lots, batches, or other units of a human drug product that is or will be included in the Stra-tegic National Stockpile. \\n[52 FR 8831, Mar. 19, 1987, as amended at 72 \\nFR 73599, Dec. 28, 2007] \\n§ 312.7 Promotion of investigational \\ndrugs. \\n(a) Promotion of an investigational new \\ndrug. A sponsor or investigator, or any \\nperson acting on behalf of a sponsor or investigator, shall not represent in a promotional context that an investiga-tional new drug is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is under in-vestigation or otherwise promote the drug. This provision is not intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information concerning the drug, in-cluding dissemination of scientific findings in scientific or lay media. Rather, its intent is to restrict pro-motional claims of safety or effective-ness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation and to preclude commercialization of the drug before it is approved for commercial distribu-tion. \\n(b) Commercial distribution of an inves-\\ntigational new drug. A sponsor or inves-\\ntigator shall not commercially dis-tribute or test market an investiga-tional new drug. \\n(c) Prolonging an investigation.

A sponsor \\nwho wishes to charge for its investiga-tional drug, including investigational use of its approved drug, must: \\n(i) Provide evidence that the drug has \\na potential clinical benefit that, if demonstrated in the clinical investiga-tions, would provide a significant ad-vantage over available products in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of a disease or condition; \\n(ii) Demonstrate that the data to be \\nobtained from the clinical trial would be essential to establishing that the drug is effective or safe for the purpose of obtaining initial approval of a drug, or would support a significant change in the labeling of an approved drug (e.g., new indication, inclusion of com-parative safety information); and \\n(iii) Demonstrate that the clinical \\ntrial could not be conducted without charging because the cost of the drug is extraordinary to the sponsor. The cost may be extraordinary due to manufac-turing complexity, scarcity of a nat-ural resource, the large quantity of drug needed (e.g., due to the size or du-ration of the trial), or some combina-tion of these or other extraordinary circumstances (e.g., resources available to a sponsor). \\n(2) Duration of charging in a clinical \\ntrial. Unless FDA specifies a shorter pe-riod, charging may continue for the \\nlength of the clinical trial. \\n(c) Charging for expanded access to in-\\nvestigational drug for treatment use. (1) A \\nsponsor who wishes to charge for ex-panded access to an investigational drug for treatment use under subpart I of this part must provide reasonable assurance that charging will not inter-fere with developing the drug for mar-keting approval. \\n(2) For expanded access under §312.320 \\n(treatment IND or treatment protocol), such assurance must include: \\n(i) Evidence of sufficient enrollment \\nin any ongoing clinical trial(s) needed for marketing approval to reasonably assure FDA that the trial(s) will be successfully completed as planned; \\n(ii) Evidence of adequate progress in \\nthe development of the drug for mar-keting approval; and \\n(iii) Information submitted under the \\ngeneral investigational plan (§312.23(a)(3)(iv)) specifying the drug development milestones the sponsor plans to meet in the next year. \\n(3) The authorization to charge is \\nlimited to the number of patients au-thorized to receive the drug under the treatment use, if there is a limitation. \\n(4) Unless FDA specifies a shorter pe-\\nriod, charging for expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use under subpart I of this part may continue for 1 year from the time of FDA authorization. A sponsor may re-quest that FDA reauthorize charging for additional periods. \\n(d) Costs recoverable when charging for \\nan investigational drug. (1) A sponsor \\nmay recover only the direct costs of making its investigational drug avail-able. \\n(i) Direct costs are costs incurred by \\na sponsor that can be specifically and exclusively attributed to providing the drug for the investigational use for which FDA has authorized cost recov-ery. Direct costs include costs per unit to manufacture the drug (e.g., raw ma-terials, labor, and nonreusable supplies and equipment used to manufacture the quantity of drug needed for the use for which charging is authorized) or costs to acquire the drug from another manufacturing source, and direct costs to ship and handle (e.g., store) the drug. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '51', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

      "page_content='57 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 312.22 \\nstudies are typically closely monitored \\nand may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. These stud-ies are designed to determine the me-tabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects as-sociated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on ef-fectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug’s phar-macokinetics and pharmacological ef-fects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. The total num-ber of subjects and patients included in Phase 1 studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. \\n(2) Phase 1 studies also include stud-\\nies of drug metabolism, structure-ac-tivity relationships, and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. \\n(b) Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the con-\\ntrolled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indica-tions in patients with the disease or condition under study and to deter-mine the common short-term side ef-fects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and con-ducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. \\n(c) Phase 3. Phase 3 studies are ex-\\npanded controlled and uncontrolled trials. They are performed after pre-liminary evidence suggesting effective-ness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually include from several hundred to several thousand subjects. \\n§ 312.22 General principles of the IND \\nsubmission. \\n(a) FDA’s primary objectives in re-\\nviewing an IND are, in all phases of the investigation, to assure the safety and rights of subjects, and, in Phase 2 and 3, to help assure that the quality of the scientific evaluation of drugs is ade-quate to permit an evaluation of the \\ndrug’s effectiveness and safety. There-fore, although FDA’s review of Phase 1 submissions will focus on assessing the safety of Phase 1 investigations, FDA’s review of Phases 2 and 3 submissions will also include an assessment of the scientific quality of the clinical inves-tigations and the likelihood that the investigations will yield data capable of meeting statutory standards for marketing approval. \\n(b) The amount of information on a \\nparticular drug that must be submitted \\nin an IND to assure the accomplish-ment of the objectives described in paragraph (a) of this section depends upon such factors as the novelty of the drug, the extent to which it has been studied previously, the known or sus-pected risks, and the developmental phase of the drug. \\n(c) The central focus of the initial \\nIND submission should be on the gen-eral investigational plan and the proto-cols for specific human studies. Subse-quent amendments to the IND that contain new or revised protocols should build logically on previous submissions and should be supported by additional information, including the results of animal toxicology studies or other human studies as appropriate. Annual reports to the IND should serve as the focus for reporting the status of studies being conducted under the IND and should update the general investiga-tional plan for the coming year. \\n(d) The IND format set forth in \\n§312.23 should be followed routinely by sponsors in the interest of fostering an efficient review of applications. Spon-sors are expected to exercise consider-able discretion, however, regarding the content of information submitted in each section, depending upon the kind of drug being studied and the nature of the available information. Section 312.23 outlines the information needed for a commercially sponsored IND for a new molecular entity. A sponsor-inves-tigator who uses, as a research tool, an investigational new drug that is al-ready subject to a manufacturer’s IND or marketing application should follow the same general format, but ordi-narily may, if authorized by the manu-facturer, refer to the manufacturer’s \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00067 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '53', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In general, protocols for Phase 1 studies may be less detailed and more flexible than protocols for Phase 2 and 3 studies. Phase 1 protocols should be directed primarily at pro-viding an outline of the investigation— an estimate of the number of patients to be involved, a description of safety exclusions, and a description of the dosing plan including duration, dose, or method to be used in determining dose—and should specify in detail only those elements of the study that are critical to safety, such as necessary monitoring of vital signs and blood chemistries. Modifications of the ex-perimental design of Phase 1 studies that do not affect critical safety as-sessments are required to be reported to FDA only in the annual report. (ii) In Phases 2 and 3, detailed proto-\\ncols describing all aspects of the study should be submitted. A protocol for a Phase 2 or 3 investigation should be de-signed in such a way that, if the spon-sor anticipates that some deviation from the study design may become nec-essary as the investigation progresses, alternatives or contingencies to pro-vide for such deviation are built into the protocols at the outset. For exam-ple, a protocol for a controlled short- term study might include a plan for an early crossover of nonresponders to an alternative therapy. \\n(iii) A protocol is required to contain \\nthe following, with the specific ele-ments and detail of the protocol re-flecting the above distinctions depend-ing on the phase of study: \\n(a) A statement of the objectives and \\npurpose of the study. \\n(b) The name and address and a state-\\nment of the qualifications (curriculum vitae or other statement of qualifica-tions) of each investigator, and the name of each subinvestigator (e.g., re-search fellow, resident) working under the supervision of the investigator; the name and address of the research fa-cilities to be used; and the name and address of each reviewing Institutional Review Board. \\n(c) The criteria for patient selection \\nand for exclusion of patients and an es-timate of the number of patients to be studied. \\n(d) A description of the design of the \\nstudy, including the kind of control group to be used, if any, and a descrip-tion of methods to be used to minimize bias on the part of subjects, investiga-tors, and analysts. \\n(e) The method for determining the \\ndose(s) to be administered, the planned maximum dosage, and the duration of individual patient exposure to the drug. \\n(f) A description of the observations \\nand measurements to be made to fulfill the objectives of the study. \\n(g) A description of clinical proce-\\ndures, laboratory tests, or other meas-ures to be taken to monitor the effects of the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk. \\n(7) Chemistry, manufacturing, and con-\\ntrol information.

Although in each phase of the investigation sufficient information is required to be submitted to assure the proper identification, quality, purity, and strength of the investigational drug, the amount of information need-ed to make that assurance will vary with the phase of the investigation, the proposed duration of the investigation, the dosage form, and the amount of in-\\nformation otherwise available. FDA recognizes that modifications to the method of preparation of the new drug substance and dosage form and changes in the dosage form itself are likely as the investigation progresses. There-fore, the emphasis in an initial Phase 1 submission should generally be placed on the identification and control of the raw materials and the new drug sub-stance. Final specifications for the drug substance and drug product are not expected until the end of the inves-tigational process. \\n(ii) It should be emphasized that the \\namount of information to be submitted depends upon the scope of the proposed clinical investigation. For example, al-though stability data are required in all phases of the IND to demonstrate that the new drug substance and drug product are within acceptable chemical and physical limits for the planned du-ration of the proposed clinical inves-tigation, if very short-term tests are proposed, the supporting stability data can be correspondingly limited. \\n(iii) As drug development proceeds \\nand as the scale or production is changed from the pilot-scale produc-tion appropriate for the limited initial clinical investigations to the larger- scale production needed for expanded clinical trials, the sponsor should sub-mit information amendments to sup-plement the initial information sub-mitted on the chemistry, manufac-turing, and control processes with in-formation appropriate to the expanded scope of the investigation. \\n(iv) Reflecting the distinctions de-\\nscribed in this paragraph (a)(7), and based on the phase(s) to be studied, the submission is required to contain the following: (a) Drug substance. A description of \\nthe drug substance, including its phys-ical, chemical, or biological character-istics; the name and address of its man-ufacturer; the general method of prepa-ration of the drug substance; the ac-ceptable limits and analytical methods used to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug sub-stance; and information sufficient to support stability of the drug substance during the toxicological studies and the planned clinical studies. Reference to the current edition of the United States Pharmacopeia—National For-mulary may satisfy relevant require-ments in this paragraph. \\n(b) Drug product. A list of all compo-\\nnents, which may include reasonable alternatives for inactive compounds, used in the manufacture of the inves-tigational drug product, including both those components intended to appear in the drug product and those which may not appear but which are used in the manufacturing process, and, where applicable, the quantitative composi-tion of the investigational drug prod-uct, including any reasonable vari-ations that may be expected during the investigational stage; the name and ad-dress of the drug product manufac-turer; a brief general description of the manufacturing and packaging proce-dure as appropriate for the product; the acceptable limits and analytical meth-ods used to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product; and information suffi-cient to assure the product’s stability during the planned clinical studies.

Depend-ing on the nature of the drug and the phase of the investigation, the descrip-tion is to include the results of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity tests; tests of the drug’s effects on reproduc-tion and the developing fetus; any spe-cial toxicity test related to the drug’s particular mode of administration or conditions of use (e.g., inhalation, der-mal, or ocular toxicology); and any in vitro studies intended to evaluate drug toxicity. \\n(b) For each toxicology study that is \\nintended primarily to support the safe-ty of the proposed clinical investiga-tion, a full tabulation of data suitable for detailed review. \\n(iii) For each nonclinical laboratory \\nstudy subject to the good laboratory practice regulations under part 58, a statement that the study was con-ducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations in part 58, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with those regulations, a \\nbrief statement of the reason for the noncompliance. \\n(9) Previous human experience with the \\ninvestigational drug. A summary of pre-\\nvious human experience known to the applicant, if any, with the investiga-tional drug. The information is re-quired to include the following: \\n(i) If the investigational drug has \\nbeen investigated or marketed pre-viously, either in the United States or other countries, detailed information about such experience that is relevant to the safety of the proposed investiga-tion or to the investigation’s rationale. If the drug has been the subject of con-trolled trials, detailed information on such trials that is relevant to an as-sessment of the drug’s effectiveness for the proposed investigational use(s) should also be provided. Any published material that is relevant to the safety of the proposed investigation or to an assessment of the drug’s effectiveness for its proposed investigational use should be provided in full. Published material that is less directly relevant may be supplied by a bibliography. \\n(ii) If the drug is a combination of \\ndrugs previously investigated or mar-keted, the information required under paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section should be provided for each active drug component. However, if any component in such combination is subject to an approved marketing application or is otherwise lawfully marketed in the United States, the sponsor is not re-quired to submit published material concerning that active drug component unless such material relates directly to \\nthe proposed investigational use (in-cluding publications relevant to com-ponent-component interaction). \\n(iii) If the drug has been marketed \\noutside the United States, a list of the countries in which the drug has been marketed and a list of the countries in which the drug has been withdrawn from marketing for reasons potentially related to safety or effectiveness. \\n(10) Additional information.

The following defini-\\ntions of terms apply to this section: \\nAdverse event means any untoward \\nmedical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. \\nLife-threatening adverse event or life- \\nthreatening suspected adverse reaction. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life-threat-ening’’ if, in the view of either the in-vestigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at imme-diate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Serious adverse event or serious sus-\\npected adverse reaction. An adverse \\nevent or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following out-comes: Death, a life-threatening ad-verse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliza-tion, a persistent or significant inca-pacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life func-tions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threat-ening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the out-comes listed in this definition. Exam-ples of such medical events include al-lergic bronchospasm requiring inten-sive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convul-sions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \\nSuspected adverse reaction means any \\nadverse event for which there is a rea-sonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the pur-poses of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reason-able possibility’’ means there is evi-dence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction im-plies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. \\nUnexpected adverse event or unexpected \\nsuspected adverse reaction. An adverse \\nevent or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an inves-tigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the gen-eral investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, he-patic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the inves-tigator brochure referred only to ele-vated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00074 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '60', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='65 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 312.32 \\nSimilarly, cerebral thromboembolism \\nand cerebral vasculitis would be unex-pected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. ‘‘Unex-pected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occur-ring with a class of drugs or as antici-pated from the pharmacological prop-erties of the drug, but are not specifi-cally mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. \\n(b) Review of safety information. The \\nsponsor must promptly review all in-formation relevant to the safety of the drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from foreign or domestic sources, including information derived from any clinical or epidemiological investigations, animal or in vitro stud-ies, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers, as well as reports from foreign regulatory authorities and reports of foreign com-mercial marketing experience for drugs that are not marketed in the United States. \\n(c)(1) IND safety reports. The sponsor \\nmust notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investiga-tor’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor deter-mines that the information qualifies for reporting under paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iii), or (c)(1)(iv) of this section. In each IND safety report, the sponsor must identify all IND safety reports previously submitted to FDA concerning a similar suspected adverse reaction, and must analyze the signifi-cance of the suspected adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other relevant information. \\n(i) Serious and unexpected suspected \\nadverse reaction. The sponsor must re-\\nport any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. The sponsor must report an adverse event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as: (A) A single occurrence of an event \\nthat is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Ste-vens-Johnson Syndrome); \\n(B) One or more occurrences of an \\nevent that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture); \\n(C) An aggregate analysis of specific \\nevents observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the under-lying disease or condition under inves-tigation or other events that com-monly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indi-cates those events occur more fre-quently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical con-trol group. \\n(ii) Findings from other studies. The \\nsponsor must report any findings from epidemiological studies, pooled anal-ysis of multiple studies, or clinical studies (other than those reported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this sec-tion), whether or not conducted under an IND, and whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a signifi-cant risk in humans exposed to the drug. Ordinarily, such a finding would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investi-gator brochure (excluding routine up-dates of these documents), or other as-pects of the overall conduct of the clin-ical investigation. \\n(iii) Findings from animal or in vitro \\ntesting. The sponsor must report any \\nfindings from animal or in vitro test-ing, whether or not conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a significant risk \\nin humans exposed to the drug, such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure. Ordinarily, any such findings would re-sult in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investi-gator brochure (excluding routine up-dates of these documents), or other as-pects of the overall conduct of the clin-ical investigation. \\n(iv) Increased rate of occurrence of seri-\\nous suspected adverse reactions.

FDA will periodically issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, prep-\\naration and organization of files). The sponsor may submit foreign suspected adverse reactions on a Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) I Form instead of a FDA Form 3500A.

Each notification to FDA must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., ‘‘IND Safety Report,’’ and must be transmitted to the review division in the Center for Drug Evalua-tion and Research or in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND. Upon request from FDA, the sponsor must submit to FDA any addi-tional data or information that the agency deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after receiving the re-quest. \\n(2) Unexpected fatal or life-threatening \\nsuspected adverse reaction reports. The \\nsponsor must also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 cal-endar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. \\n(3) Reporting format or frequency. FDA \\nmay require a sponsor to submit IND safety reports in a format or at a fre-quency different than that required under this paragraph. The sponsor may also propose and adopt a different re-porting format or frequency if the change is agreed to in advance by the director of the FDA review division that has responsibility for review of the IND. (4) Investigations of marketed drugs. A \\nsponsor of a clinical study of a drug marketed or approved in the United States that is conducted under an IND is required to submit IND safety re-ports for suspected adverse reactions that are observed in the clinical study, at domestic or foreign study sites. The sponsor must also submit safety infor-mation from the clinical study as pre-scribed by the postmarketing safety re-porting requirements (e.g., §§310.305, 314.80, and 600.80 of this chapter). \\n(5) Reporting study endpoints. Study \\nendpoints (e.g., mortality or major morbidity) must be reported to FDA by the sponsor as described in the protocol and ordinarily would not be reported under paragraph (c) of this section. However, if a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relation-ship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis), the event must be reported under §312.32(c)(1)(i) as a serious and unex-pected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study end-point (e.g., all-cause mortality). \\n(d) Followup. (1) The sponsor must \\npromptly investigate all safety infor-mation it receives. \\n(2) Relevant followup information to \\nan IND safety report must be sub-mitted as soon as the information is available and must be identified as such, i.e., ‘‘Followup IND Safety Re-port.’’ \\n(3) If the results of a sponsor’s inves-\\ntigation show that an adverse event not initially determined to be report-able under paragraph (c) of this section is so reportable, the sponsor must re-port such suspected adverse reaction in an IND safety report as soon as pos-sible, but in no case later than 15 cal-endar days after the determination is made. \\n(e) Disclaimer. A safety report or \\nother information submitted by a spon-sor under this part (and any release by FDA of that report or information) does not necessarily reflect a conclu-sion by the sponsor or FDA that the re-port or information constitutes an ad-mission that the drug caused or con-tributed to an adverse event.

A clinical hold is an order \\nissued by FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. The clinical hold order may apply to one or more of the investigations covered by an IND. When a proposed study is placed on clinical hold, subjects may not be given the investigational drug. When an ongoing study is placed on clinical hold, no new subjects may be recruited to the study and placed on the investigational drug; patients al-ready in the study should be taken off therapy involving the investigational drug unless specifically permitted by FDA in the interest of patient safety. \\n(b) Grounds for imposition of clinical \\nhold—(1) Clinical hold of a Phase 1 study \\nunder an IND. FDA may place a pro-\\nposed or ongoing Phase 1 investigation on clinical hold if it finds that: \\n(i) Human subjects are or would be \\nexposed to an unreasonable and signifi-cant risk of illness or injury; \\n(ii) The clinical investigators named \\nin the IND are not qualified by reason of their scientific training and experi-ence to conduct the investigation de-scribed in the IND; \\n(iii) The investigator brochure is \\nmisleading, erroneous, or materially incomplete; or \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00078 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '64', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='69 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 312.42 \\n(iv) The IND does not contain suffi-\\ncient information required under §312.23 to assess the risks to subjects of the proposed studies. \\n(v) The IND is for the study of an in-\\nvestigational drug intended to treat a life-threatening disease or condition that affects both genders, and men or women with reproductive potential who have the disease or condition being studied are excluded from eligi-bility because of a risk or potential risk from use of the investigational drug of reproductive toxicity ( i.e., af-\\nfecting reproductive organs) or devel-opmental toxicity ( i.e., affecting poten-\\ntial offspring). The phrase ‘‘women with reproductive potential’’ does not include pregnant women. For purposes of this paragraph, ‘‘life-threatening ill-nesses or diseases’’ are defined as ‘‘dis-eases or conditions where the likeli-hood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted.’’ The clin-ical hold would not apply under this paragraph to clinical studies con-ducted: \\n(A) Under special circumstances, \\nsuch as studies pertinent only to one \\ngender (e.g., studies evaluating the ex-cretion of a drug in semen or the ef-fects on menstrual function); \\n(B) Only in men or women, as long as \\na study that does not exclude members of the other gender with reproductive potential is being conducted concur-rently, has been conducted, or will take place within a reasonable time agreed upon by the agency; or \\n(C) Only in subjects who do not suffer \\nfrom the disease or condition for which the drug is being studied. \\n(2) Clinical hold of a Phase 2 or 3 study \\nunder an IND. FDA may place a pro-\\nposed or ongoing Phase 2 or 3 inves-tigation on clinical hold if it finds that: \\n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\\ngraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(v) of this section apply; or \\n(ii) The plan or protocol for the in-\\nvestigation is clearly deficient in de-sign to meet its stated objectives. \\n(3) Clinical hold of an expanded access \\nIND or expanded access protocol. FDA \\nmay place an expanded access IND or expanded access protocol on clinical hold under the following conditions: (i) Final use. FDA may place a pro-\\nposed expanded access IND or treat-ment use protocol on clinical hold if it is determined that: \\n(A) The pertinent criteria in subpart \\nI of this part for permitting the ex-panded access use to begin are not sat-isfied; or \\n(B) The expanded access IND or ex-\\npanded access protocol does not comply with the requirements for expanded ac-cess submissions in subpart I of this part. \\n(ii) Ongoing use. FDA may place an \\nongoing expanded access IND or ex-panded access protocol on clinical hold if it is determined that the pertinent criteria in subpart I of this part for permitting the expanded access are no longer satisfied. \\n(4) Clinical hold of any study that is \\nnot designed to be adequate and well-con-trolled. FDA may place a proposed or \\nongoing investigation that is not de-signed to be adequate and well-con-trolled on clinical hold if it finds that: \\n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\\ngraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section apply; or \\n(ii) There is reasonable evidence the \\ninvestigation that is not designed to be adequate and well-controlled is imped-ing enrollment in, or otherwise inter-fering with the conduct or completion of, a study that is designed to be an adequate and well-controlled investiga-tion of the same or another investiga-tional drug; or \\n(iii) Insufficient quantities of the in-\\nvestigational drug exist to adequately conduct both the investigation that is not designed to be adequate and well- controlled and the investigations that are designed to be adequate and well- controlled; or \\n(iv) The drug has been studied in one \\nor more adequate and well-controlled investigations that strongly suggest lack of effectiveness; or \\n(v) Another drug under investigation \\nor approved for the same indication and available to the same patient popu-lation has demonstrated a better po-tential benefit/risk balance; or \\n(vi) The drug has received marketing \\napproval for the same indication in the same patient population; or \\n(vii) The sponsor of the study that is \\ndesigned to be an adequate and well- \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00079 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '65', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

FDA ordinarily intends that clinical holds under paragraphs (b)(4)(ii), (b)(4)(iii) and (b)(4)(v) of this section would only apply to additional enrollment in nonconcurrently con-trolled trials rather than eliminating continued access to individuals already receiving the investigational drug. \\n(5) Clinical hold of any investigation in-\\nvolving an exception from informed con-sent under §50.24 of this chapter. FDA \\nmay place a proposed or ongoing inves-tigation involving an exception from informed consent under §50.24 of this chapter on clinical hold if it is deter-mined that: \\n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\\ngraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section apply; or \\n(ii) The pertinent criteria in §50.24 of \\nthis chapter for such an investigation to begin or continue are not submitted or not satisfied. \\n(6) Clinical hold of any investigation \\ninvolving an exception from informed consent under §50.23(d) of this chapter. FDA may place a proposed or ongoing investigation involving an exception from informed consent under §50.23(d) of this chapter on clinical hold if it is determined that: \\n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\\ngraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section apply; or \\n(ii) A determination by the President \\nto waive the prior consent requirement for the administration of an investiga-tional new drug has not been made. \\n(c) Discussion of deficiency. Whenever \\nFDA concludes that a deficiency exists in a clinical investigation that may be grounds for the imposition of clinical hold FDA will, unless patients are ex-posed to immediate and serious risk, attempt to discuss and satisfactorily resolve the matter with the sponsor be-fore issuing the clinical hold order. \\n(d) Imposition of clinical hold. The \\nclinical hold order may be made by telephone or other means of rapid com-munication or in writing. The clinical hold order will identify the studies under the IND to which the hold ap-\\nplies, and will briefly explain the basis for the action. The clinical hold order will be made by or on behalf of the Di-vision Director with responsibility for review of the IND. As soon as possible, and no more than 30 days after imposi-tion of the clinical hold, the Division Director will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. \\n(e) Resumption of clinical investiga-\\ntions. An investigation may only re-\\nsume after FDA (usually the Division Director, or the Director’s designee, with responsibility for review of the IND) has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. Resump-tion of the affected investigation(s) will be authorized when the sponsor corrects the deficiency(ies) previously cited or otherwise satisfies the agency that the investigation(s) can proceed. FDA may notify a sponsor of its deter-mination regarding the clinical hold by telephone or other means of rapid com-munication. If a sponsor of an IND that has been placed on clinical hold re-quests in writing that the clinical hold be removed and submits a complete re-sponse to the issue(s) identified in the clinical hold order, FDA shall respond in writing to the sponsor within 30-cal-endar days of receipt of the request and the complete response. FDA’s response will either remove or maintain the clinical hold, and will state the reasons for such determination. Notwith-standing the 30-calendar day response time, a sponsor may not proceed with a clinical trial on which a clinical hold has been imposed until the sponsor has been notified by FDA that the hold has been lifted. \\n(f) Appeal. If the sponsor disagrees \\nwith the reasons cited for the clinical hold, the sponsor may request recon-sideration of the decision in accord-ance with §312.48. \\n(g) Conversion of IND on clinical hold \\nto inactive status.

This section describes the \\nprocedures under which FDA may ter-minate an IND. If an IND is termi-nated, the sponsor shall end all clinical investigations conducted under the IND and recall or otherwise provide for the disposition of all unused supplies of the drug. A termination action may be based on deficiencies in the IND or in the conduct of an investigation under an IND. Except as provided in para-graph (d) of this section, a termination shall be preceded by a proposal to ter-minate by FDA and an opportunity for the sponsor to respond. FDA will, in general, only initiate an action under this section after first attempting to resolve differences informally or, when appropriate, through the clinical hold procedures described in §312.42. \\n(b) Grounds for termination —(1) Phase \\n1. FDA may propose to terminate an \\nIND during Phase 1 if it finds that: \\n(i) Human subjects would be exposed \\nto an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. \\n(ii) The IND does not contain suffi-\\ncient information required under §312.23 to assess the safety to subjects of the clinical investigations. \\n(iii) The methods, facilities, and con-\\ntrols used for the manufacturing, proc-essing, and packing of the investiga-tional drug are inadequate to establish and maintain appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity as needed for subject safety. \\n(iv) The clinical investigations are \\nbeing conducted in a manner substan-tially different than that described in the protocols submitted in the IND. \\n(v) The drug is being promoted or dis-\\ntributed for commercial purposes not justified by the requirements of the in-vestigation or permitted by §312.7. \\n(vi) The IND, or any amendment or \\nreport to the IND, contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits material information required by this part. (vii) The sponsor fails promptly to in-\\nvestigate and inform the Food and Drug Administration and all investiga-tors of serious and unexpected adverse experiences in accordance with §312.32 or fails to make any other report re-quired under this part. \\n(viii) The sponsor fails to submit an \\naccurate annual report of the inves-tigations in accordance with §312.33. \\n(ix) The sponsor fails to comply with \\nany other applicable requirement of this part, part 50, or part 56. \\n(x) The IND has remained on inactive \\nstatus for 5 years or more. \\n(xi) The sponsor fails to delay a pro-\\nposed investigation under the IND or to suspend an ongoing investigation that has been placed on clinical hold under §312.42(b)(4). \\n(2) Phase 2 or 3. FDA may propose to \\nterminate an IND during Phase 2 or Phase 3 if FDA finds that: \\n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\\ngraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(xi) of this section apply; or \\n(ii) The investigational plan or pro-\\ntocol(s) is not reasonable as a bona fide scientific plan to determine whether or not the drug is safe and effective for use; or \\n(iii) There is convincing evidence \\nthat the drug is not effective for the purpose for which it is being inves-tigated. \\n(3) FDA may propose to terminate a \\ntreatment IND if it finds that: \\n(i) Any of the conditions in para-\\ngraphs (b)(1)(i) through (x) of this sec-tion apply; or \\n(ii) Any of the conditions in \\n§312.42(b)(3) apply. \\n(c) Opportunity for sponsor response. \\n(1) If FDA proposes to terminate an IND, FDA will notify the sponsor in writing, and invite correction or expla-nation within a period of 30 days. \\n(2) On such notification, the sponsor \\nmay provide a written explanation or correction or may request a conference with FDA to provide the requested ex-planation or correction.

This action may be taken by FDA either on request of the sponsor or on FDA’s own initiative. If FDA seeks to act on its own initiative under this sec-tion, it shall first notify the sponsor in writing of the proposed inactive status. Upon receipt of such notification, the sponsor shall have 30 days to respond as to why the IND should continue to remain active. \\n(b) If an IND is placed on inactive \\nstatus, all investigators shall be so no-tified and all stocks of the drug shall be returned or otherwise disposed of in accordance with §312.59. \\n(c) A sponsor is not required to sub-\\nmit annual reports to an IND on inac-tive status.

If the protocol amendment relies on information pre-viously submitted, the plan shall ref-erence such information. Additional in-formation supporting the proposed in-vestigation, if any, shall be submitted in an information amendment. Not-withstanding the provisions of §312.30, clinical investigations under an IND on inactive status may only resume (1) 30 \\ndays after FDA receives the protocol amendment, unless FDA notifies the sponsor that the investigations de-scribed in the amendment are subject to a clinical hold under §312.42, or (2) on earlier notification by FDA that the clinical investigations described in the protocol amendment may begin. \\n(e) An IND that remains on inactive \\nstatus for 5 years or more may be ter-minated under §312.44. \\n[52 FR 8831, Mar. 19, 1987, as amended at 52 \\nFR 23031, June 17, 1987; 67 FR 9586, Mar. 4, 2002] \\n§ 312.47 Meetings. \\n(a) General. Meetings between a spon-\\nsor and the agency are frequently use-ful in resolving questions and issues raised during the course of a clinical investigation. FDA encourages such meetings to the extent that they aid in the evaluation of the drug and in the solution of scientific problems con-cerning the drug, to the extent that FDA’s resources permit. The general principle underlying the conduct of such meetings is that there should be free, full, and open communication about any scientific or medical ques-tion that may arise during the clinical investigation. These meetings shall be conducted and documented in accord-ance with part 10. \\n(b) ‘‘End-of-Phase 2’’ meetings and \\nmeetings held before submission of a mar-keting application.

      "page_content='73 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 312.47 \\ncan be especially helpful in minimizing \\nwasteful expenditures of time and money and thus in speeding the drug development and evaluation process. In particular, FDA has found that meet-ings at the end of Phase 2 of an inves-tigation (end-of-Phase 2 meetings) are of considerable assistance in planning later studies and that meetings held near completion of Phase 3 and before submission of a marketing application (‘‘pre-NDA’’ meetings) are helpful in developing methods of presentation and submission of data in the mar-keting application that facilitate re-view and allow timely FDA response. \\n(1) End-of-Phase 2 meetings —(i) Pur-\\npose. The purpose of an end-of-phase 2 \\nmeeting is to determine the safety of proceeding to Phase 3, to evaluate the Phase 3 plan and protocols and the ade-quacy of current studies and plans to assess pediatric safety and effective-ness, and to identify any additional in-formation necessary to support a mar-keting application for the uses under investigation. \\n(ii) Eligibility for meeting. While the \\nend-of-Phase 2 meeting is designed pri-marily for IND’s involving new molec-ular entities or major new uses of mar-keted drugs, a sponsor of any IND may request and obtain an end-of-Phase 2 meeting. \\n(iii) Timing. To be most useful to the \\nsponsor, end-of-Phase 2 meetings should be held before major commit-ments of effort and resources to spe-cific Phase 3 tests are made. The sched-uling of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting is not, however, intended to delay the transition of an investigation from Phase 2 to Phase 3. \\n(iv) Advance information. At least 1 \\nmonth in advance of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting, the sponsor should submit background information on the spon-sor’s plan for Phase 3, including sum-maries of the Phase 1 and 2 investiga-tions, the specific protocols for Phase 3 clinical studies, plans for any addi-tional nonclinical studies, plans for pe-diatric studies, including a time line for protocol finalization, enrollment, completion, and data analysis, or infor-mation to support any planned request for waiver or deferral of pediatric stud-ies, and, if available, tentative labeling for the drug. The recommended con-tents of such a submission are de-\\nscribed more fully in FDA Staff Man-ual Guide 4850.7 that is publicly avail-able under FDA’s public information regulations in part 20. \\n(v) Conduct of meeting. Arrangements \\nfor an end-of-Phase 2 meeting are to be made with the division in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research which is responsible for review of the IND. The meeting will be scheduled by FDA at a time convenient to both FDA and the sponsor. Both the sponsor and FDA may bring consult-ants to the meeting. The meeting should be directed primarily at estab-lishing agreement between FDA and the sponsor of the overall plan for Phase 3 and the objectives and design of particular studies. The adequacy of \\nthe technical information to support Phase 3 studies and/or a marketing ap-plication may also be discussed. FDA will also provide its best judgment, at that time, of the pediatric studies that will be required for the drug product and whether their submission will be deferred until after approval. Agree-ments reached at the meeting on these matters will be recorded in minutes of the conference that will be taken by FDA in accordance with §10.65 and pro-vided to the sponsor. The minutes along with any other written material provided to the sponsor will serve as a permanent record of any agreements reached. Barring a significant sci-entific development that requires oth-erwise, studies conducted in accord-ance with the agreement shall be pre-sumed to be sufficient in objective and design for the purpose of obtaining marketing approval for the drug. \\n(2) ‘‘Pre-NDA’’ and ‘‘pre-BLA’’ meet-\\nings. FDA has found that delays associ-\\nated with the initial review of a mar-keting application may be reduced by exchanges of information about a pro-posed marketing application. The pri-mary purpose of this kind of exchange is to uncover any major unresolved problems, to identify those studies that the sponsor is relying on as adequate and well-controlled to establish the drug’s effectiveness, to identify the status of ongoing or needed studies adequate to assess pediatric safety and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00083 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '69', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Arrangements for such a meeting are to be initiated by the sponsor with the division re-sponsible for review of the IND. To per-mit FDA to provide the sponsor with the most useful advice on preparing a marketing application, the sponsor should submit to FDA’s reviewing divi-sion at least 1 month in advance of the meeting the following information: \\n(i) A brief summary of the clinical \\nstudies to be submitted in the applica-tion. \\n(ii) A proposed format for organizing \\nthe submission, including methods for presenting the data. \\n(iii) Information on the status of \\nneeded or ongoing pediatric studies. \\n(iv) Any other information for discus-\\nsion at the meeting. \\n[52 FR 8831, Mar. 19, 1987, as amended at 52 \\nFR 23031, June 17, 1987; 55 FR 11580, Mar. 29, 1990; 63 FR 66669, Dec. 2, 1998; 67 FR 9586, Mar. 4, 2002] \\n§ 312.48 Dispute resolution. \\n(a) General. The Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration is committed to resolving differences between sponsors and FDA reviewing divisions with respect to re-quirements for IND’s as quickly and amicably as possible through the coop-erative exchange of information and views. \\n(b) Administrative and procedural \\nissues. When administrative or proce-\\ndural disputes arise, the sponsor should first attempt to resolve the matter with the division in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or Cen-ter for Biologics Evaluation and Re-search which is responsible for review of the IND, beginning with the con-sumer safety officer assigned to the ap-plication. If the dispute is not resolved, the sponsor may raise the matter with the person designated as ombudsman, whose function shall be to investigate what has happened and to facilitate a timely and equitable resolution. Appro-priate issues to raise with the ombuds-man include resolving difficulties in \\nscheduling meetings and obtaining timely replies to inquiries. Further de-tails on this procedure are contained in FDA Staff Manual Guide 4820.7 that is publicly available under FDA’s public information regulations in part 20. \\n(c) Scientific and medical disputes. (1) \\nWhen scientific or medical disputes arise during the drug investigation process, sponsors should discuss the matter directly with the responsible reviewing officials. If necessary, spon-sors may request a meeting with the appropriate reviewing officials and management representatives in order to seek a resolution. Requests for such meetings shall be directed to the direc-tor of the division in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or Cen-ter for Biologics Evaluation and Re-search which is responsible for review of the IND. FDA will make every at-tempt to grant requests for meetings that involve important issues and that can be scheduled at mutually conven-ient times. \\n(2) The ‘‘end-of-Phase 2’’ and ‘‘pre- \\nNDA’’ meetings described in §312.47(b) will also provide a timely forum for discussing and resolving scientific and medical issues on which the sponsor disagrees with the agency. \\n(3) In requesting a meeting designed \\nto resolve a scientific or medical dis-pute, applicants may suggest that FDA seek the advice of outside experts, in which case FDA may, in its discretion, invite to the meeting one or more of its advisory committee members or other consultants, as designated by the agen-cy. Applicants may rely on, and may bring to any meeting, their own con-sultants. For major scientific and med-ical policy issues not resolved by infor-mal meetings, FDA may refer the mat-ter to one of its standing advisory com-mittees for its consideration and rec-ommendations. \\n[52 FR 8831, Mar. 19, 1987, as amended at 55 \\nFR 11580, Mar. 29, 1990] \\nSubpart D—Responsibilities of \\nSponsors and Investigators \\n§ 312.50 General responsibilities of \\nsponsors. \\nSponsors are responsible for selecting \\nqualified investigators, providing them \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00084 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '70', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Any such transfer shall be described in writing. If not all obligations are transferred, the writing is required to describe each of the obli-gations being assumed by the contract research organization. If all obligations are transferred, a general statement that all obligations have been trans-ferred is acceptable. Any obligation not covered by the written description shall be deemed not to have been trans-ferred. \\n(b) A contract research organization \\nthat assumes any obligation of a spon-sor shall comply with the specific regu-lations in this chapter applicable to this obligation and shall be subject to the same regulatory action as a spon-sor for failure to comply with any obli-gation assumed under these regula-tions. Thus, all references to ‘‘sponsor’’ in this part apply to a contract re-search organization to the extent that it assumes one or more obligations of the sponsor. \\n§ 312.53 Selecting investigators and \\nmonitors. \\n(a) Selecting investigators.

If an explanation is offered and accepted by the applicable Center, the Center will discontinue the disqualification proceeding. If an ex-planation is offered but not accepted by the applicable Center, the investi-gator will be given an opportunity for a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is eligible to receive test articles under this part and eligi-ble to conduct any clinical investiga-tion that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for prod-ucts regulated by FDA. \\n(b) After evaluating all available in-\\nformation, including any explanation presented by the investigator, if the Commissioner determines that the in-vestigator has repeatedly or delib-erately failed to comply with the re-quirements of this part, part 50 or part 56 of this chapter, or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted to FDA or to the sponsor false information in any required report, the Commissioner will notify the investigator, the sponsor of any investigation in which the investi-gator has been named as a participant, and the reviewing institutional review boards (IRBs) that the investigator is not eligible to receive test articles under this part. The notification to the investigator, sponsor, and IRBs will provide a statement of the basis for \\nsuch determination. The notification also will explain that an investigator determined to be ineligible to receive test articles under this part will be in-eligible to conduct any clinical inves-tigation that supports an application for a research or marketing permit for products regulated by FDA, including drugs, biologics, devices, new animal drugs, foods, including dietary supple-ments, that bear a nutrient content claim or a health claim, infant for-\\nmulas, food and color additives, and to-bacco products. \\n(c) Each application or submission to \\nFDA under the provisions of this chap-ter containing data reported by an in-vestigator who has been determined to be ineligible to receive FDA-regulated test articles is subject to examination to determine whether the investigator has submitted unreliable data that are essential to the continuation of an in-vestigation or essential to the approval of a marketing application, or essen-tial to the continued marketing of an FDA-regulated product. \\n(d) If the Commissioner determines, \\nafter the unreliable data submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is reasonably safe to continue the investigation, the Commissioner will notify the sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hear-ing under part 16 of this chapter.

As stated §314.105(c) of this chapter, while the statutory standards of safety and effec-tiveness apply to all drugs, the many kinds of drugs that are subject to them, and the wide range of uses for those drugs, demand flexibility in ap-plying the standards. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has deter-mined that it is appropriate to exercise the broadest flexibility in applying the statutory standards, while preserving appropriate guarantees for safety and effectiveness. These procedures reflect the recognition that physicians and pa-tients are generally willing to accept greater risks or side effects from prod-ucts that treat life-threatening and se-verely-debilitating illnesses, than they would accept from products that treat \\nless serious illnesses. These procedures also reflect the recognition that the benefits of the drug need to be evalu-ated in light of the severity of the dis-ease being treated. The procedure out-lined in this section should be inter-preted consistent with that purpose. \\n§ 312.81 Scope. \\nThis section applies to new drug and \\nbiological products that are being stud-ied for their safety and effectiveness in treating life-threatening or severely- debilitating diseases. \\n(a) For purposes of this section, the \\nterm ‘‘life-threatening’’ means: \\n(1) Diseases or conditions where the \\nlikelihood of death is high unless the course of the disease is interrupted; and \\n(2) Diseases or conditions with poten-\\ntially fatal outcomes, where the end point of clinical trial analysis is sur-vival. \\n(b) For purposes of this section, the \\nterm ‘‘severely debilitating’’ means diseases or conditions that cause major irreversible morbidity. \\n(c) Sponsors are encouraged to con-\\nsult with FDA on the applicability of these procedures to specific products. \\n[53 FR 41523, Oct. 21, 1988, as amended at 64 \\nFR 401, Jan. 5, 1999] \\n§ 312.82 Early consultation. \\nFor products intended to treat life- \\nthreatening or severely-debilitating ill-nesses, sponsors may request to meet with FDA-reviewing officials early in the drug development process to review and reach agreement on the design of necessary preclinical and clinical stud-ies.

When data \\nfrom phase 1 clinical testing are avail-able, the sponsor may again request a meeting with FDA-reviewing officials. The primary purpose of this meeting is to review and reach agreement on the design of phase 2 controlled clinical trials, with the goal that such testing will be adequate to provide sufficient data on the drug’s safety and effective-ness to support a decision on its ap-provability for marketing, and to dis-cuss the need for, as well as the design and timing of, studies of the drug in pe-diatric patients. For drugs for life- threatening diseases, FDA will provide its best judgment, at that time, wheth-er pediatric studies will be required and whether their submission will be deferred until after approval. The pro-cedures outlined in §312.47(b)(1) with respect to end-of-phase 2 conferences, including documentation of agree-ments reached, would also be used for end-of-phase 1 meetings. \\n[53 FR 41523, Oct. 21, 1988, as amended at 63 \\nFR 66669, Dec. 2, 1998] \\n§ 312.83 Treatment protocols. \\nIf the preliminary analysis of phase 2 \\ntest results appears promising, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit a treat-ment protocol to be reviewed under the procedures and criteria listed in §§312.305 and 312.320. Such a treatment protocol, if requested and granted, \\nwould normally remain in effect while the complete data necessary for a mar-keting application are being assembled by the sponsor and reviewed by FDA (unless grounds exist for clinical hold of ongoing protocols, as provided in §312.42(b)(3)(ii)). \\n[53 FR 41523, Oct. 21, 1988, as amended at 76 \\nFR 13880, Mar. 15, 2011] \\n§ 312.84 Risk-benefit analysis in review \\nof marketing applications for drugs to treat life-threatening and se-verely-debilitating illnesses. \\n(a) FDA’s application of the statu-\\ntory standards for marketing approval shall recognize the need for a medical risk-benefit judgment in making the \\nfinal decision on approvability. As part of this evaluation, consistent with the statement of purpose in §312.80, FDA will consider whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the known and po-tential risks of the drug and the need to answer remaining questions about risks and benefits of the drug, taking into consideration the severity of the disease and the absence of satisfactory alternative therapy. \\n(b) In making decisions on whether \\nto grant marketing approval for prod-ucts that have been the subject of an end-of-phase 1 meeting under §312.82, FDA will usually seek the advice of outside expert scientific consultants or advisory committees. Upon the filing of such a marketing application under §314.101 or part 601 of this chapter, FDA will notify the members of the relevant standing advisory committee of the ap-plication’s filing and its availability for review. \\n(c) If FDA concludes that the data \\npresented are not sufficient for mar-keting approval, FDA will issue a com-plete response letter under §314.110 of this chapter or the biological product licensing procedures. Such letter, in \\ndescribing the deficiencies in the appli-cation, will address why the results of the research design agreed to under §312.82, or in subsequent meetings, have not provided sufficient evidence for marketing approval.

GCP does not require informed consent in life-threatening situations when the IEC reviewing the study finds, before initiation of the study, that informed consent is not feasible and either that the conditions present are consistent with those described in §50.23 or §50.24(a) of this chapter, or that the measures described in the study pro-tocol or elsewhere will protect the rights, safety, and well-being of sub-jects; and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00095 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '81', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

This subpart contains the \\nrequirements for the use of investiga-tional new drugs and approved drugs where availability is limited by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) when the primary purpose is to diagnose, monitor, or treat a patient’s disease or condition. The aim of this subpart is to facilitate the availability of such drugs to patients with serious diseases or conditions when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the patient’s disease or condition. \\n(b) Definitions. The following defini-\\ntions of terms apply to this subpart: \\nImmediately life-threatening disease or \\ncondition means a stage of disease in \\nwhich there is reasonable likelihood that death will occur within a matter of months or in which premature death is likely without early treatment. \\nSerious disease or condition means a \\ndisease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning. Short-lived and self-limiting morbidity will usu-ally not be sufficient, but the mor-bidity need not be irreversible, pro-vided it is persistent or recurrent. Whether a disease or condition is seri-ous is a matter of clinical judgment, based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left un-treated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one. § 312.305 Requirements for all ex-\\npanded access uses. \\nThe criteria, submission require-\\nments, safeguards, and beginning treat-ment information set out in this sec-tion apply to all expanded access uses described in this subpart. Additional criteria, submission requirements, and safeguards that apply to specific types of expanded access are described in §§312.310 through 312.320. \\n(a) Criteria. FDA must determine \\nthat: \\n(1) The patient or patients to be \\ntreated have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfac-tory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condi-tion; \\n(2) The potential patient benefit jus-\\ntifies the potential risks of the treat-ment use and those potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated; and \\n(3) Providing the investigational drug \\nfor the requested use will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or com-pletion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use. \\n(b) Submission. (1) An expanded access \\nsubmission is required for each type of expanded access described in this sub-part. The submission may be a new \\nIND or a protocol amendment to an ex-isting IND. Information required for a submission may be supplied by refer-ring to pertinent information con-tained in an existing IND if the sponsor of the existing IND grants a right of reference to the IND. \\n(2) The expanded access submission \\nmust include: \\n(i) A cover sheet (Form FDA 1571) \\nmeeting the requirements of §312.23(a); \\n(ii) The rationale for the intended use \\nof the drug, including a list of available therapeutic options that would ordi-narily be tried before resorting to the investigational drug or an explanation of why the use of the investigational drug is preferable to the use of avail-able therapeutic options; \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00099 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '85', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(3) A licensed physician under whose \\nimmediate direction an investigational drug is administered or dispensed, and who submits an IND for expanded ac-cess use under this subpart is consid-ered a sponsor-investigator , for purposes \\nof this part, and must comply with the responsibilities for sponsors and inves-tigators set forth in subpart D of this part to the extent they are applicable to the expanded access use. \\n(4) Investigators. In all cases of ex-\\npanded access, investigators are re-sponsible for reporting adverse drug events to the sponsor, ensuring that the informed consent requirements of part 50 of this chapter are met, ensur-ing that IRB review of the expanded ac-cess use is obtained in a manner con-sistent with the requirements of part 56 of this chapter, and maintaining ac-curate case histories and drug disposi-tion records and retaining records in a manner consistent with the require-ments of §312.62. Depending on the type of expanded access, other investigator responsibilities under subpart D may also apply. \\n(5) Sponsors. In all cases of expanded \\naccess, sponsors are responsible for submitting IND safety reports and an-nual reports (when the IND or protocol continues for 1 year or longer) to FDA as required by §§312.32 and 312.33, en-suring that licensed physicians are qualified to administer the investiga-tional drug for the expanded access use, providing licensed physicians with the information needed to minimize the risk and maximize the potential benefits of the investigational drug (the investigator’s brochure must be provided if one exists for the drug), maintaining an effective IND for the expanded access use, and maintaining adequate drug disposition records and retaining records in a manner con-sistent with the requirements of §312.57. Depending on the type of ex-panded access, other sponsor respon-sibilities under subpart D may also apply. \\n(d) Beginning treatment —(1) INDs.

For example, patients may not be able to participate in the trial because they have a different disease or stage of disease than the one being studied or otherwise do not meet the enrollment criteria, because enroll-ment in the trial is closed, or because the trial site is not geographically ac-cessible. \\n(3) Approved or related drug. (i) The \\ndrug is an approved drug product that is no longer marketed for safety rea-sons or is unavailable through mar-keting due to failure to meet the con-ditions of the approved application, or \\n(ii) The drug contains the same ac-\\ntive moiety as an approved drug prod-uct that is unavailable through mar-keting due to failure to meet the con-ditions of the approved application or a drug shortage. \\n(b) Criteria. The criteria in §312.305(a) \\nmust be met; and FDA must determine that: \\n(1) There is enough evidence that the \\ndrug is safe at the dose and duration proposed for expanded access use to justify a clinical trial of the drug in the approximate number of patients ex-\\npected to receive the drug under ex-panded access; and \\n(2) There is at least preliminary clin-\\nical evidence of effectiveness of the drug, or of a plausible pharmacologic effect of the drug to make expanded ac-cess use a reasonable therapeutic op-tion in the anticipated patient popu-lation. \\n(c) Submission. The expanded access \\nsubmission must include information adequate to satisfy FDA that the cri-teria in §312.305(a) and paragraph (b) of this section have been met. The ex-panded access submission must meet the requirements of §312.305(b). In addi-tion: \\n(1) The expanded access submission \\nmust state whether the drug is being developed or is not being developed and describe the patient population to be treated. \\n(2) If the drug is not being actively \\ndeveloped, the sponsor must explain why the drug cannot currently be de-veloped for the expanded access use and under what circumstances the drug could be developed. \\n(3) If the drug is being studied in a \\nclinical trial, the sponsor must explain why the patients to be treated cannot be enrolled in the clinical trial and under what circumstances the sponsor would conduct a clinical trial in these patients. \\n(d) Safeguards. (1) Upon review of the \\nIND annual report, FDA will determine whether it is appropriate for the ex-panded access to continue under this section. \\n(i) If the drug is not being actively \\ndeveloped or if the expanded access use is not being developed (but another use is being developed), FDA will consider whether it is possible to conduct a clin-ical study of the expanded access use. \\n(ii) If the drug is being actively de-\\nveloped, FDA will consider whether providing the investigational drug for expanded access use is interfering with the clinical development of the drug. \\n(iii) As the number of patients en-\\nrolled increases, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit an IND or protocol for the use under §312.320. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00102 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '88', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The criteria in §312.305(a) \\nmust be met, and FDA must determine that: \\n(1) Trial status. (i) The drug is being \\ninvestigated in a controlled clinical \\ntrial under an IND designed to support a marketing application for the ex-panded access use, or \\n(ii) All clinical trials of the drug \\nhave been completed; and \\n(2) Marketing status. The sponsor is \\nactively pursuing marketing approval of the drug for the expanded access use with due diligence; and \\n(3) Evidence. (i) When the expanded \\naccess use is for a serious disease or condition, there is sufficient clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness to support the expanded access use. Such evidence would ordinarily consist of data from phase 3 trials, but could con-sist of compelling data from completed phase 2 trials; or \\n(ii) When the expanded access use is \\nfor an immediately life-threatening disease or condition, the available sci-entific evidence, taken as a whole, pro-vides a reasonable basis to conclude that the investigational drug may be effective for the expanded access use and would not expose patients to an unreasonable and significant risk of ill-ness or injury. This evidence would or-dinarily consist of clinical data from phase 3 or phase 2 trials, but could be based on more preliminary clinical evi-dence. \\n(b) Submission. The expanded access \\nsubmission must include information adequate to satisfy FDA that the cri-teria in §312.305(a) and paragraph (a) of this section have been met. The ex-panded access submission must meet the requirements of §312.305(b). \\n(c) Safeguard.

These regulations are also intended to establish an effective system for FDA’s surveillance of mar-keted drugs. These regulations shall be construed in light of these objectives. \\n§ 314.3 Definitions. \\n(a) The definitions and interpreta-\\ntions contained in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to those terms when used in this part and part 320 of this chapter. \\n(b) The following definitions of terms \\napply to this part and part 320 of this chapter: \\n180-day exclusivity period is the 180- \\nday period beginning on the date of the first commercial marketing of the drug (including the commercial marketing of the reference listed drug) by any first applicant. The 180-day period ends on the day before the date on which an ANDA submitted by an applicant other than a first applicant could be ap-proved. \\n505(b)(2) application is an NDA sub-\\nmitted under section 505(b)(1) of the \\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for a drug for which at least some of the investigations described in section 505(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the NDA were not conducted by or for the appli-cant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the in-vestigations were conducted. \\nAbbreviated application, abbreviated \\nnew drug application, or ANDA is the ap-\\nplication described under §314.94, in-cluding all amendments and supple-ments to the application. \\nAcknowledgment letter is a written, \\npostmarked communication from FDA to an applicant stating that the Agen-\\ncy has determined that an ANDA is sufficiently complete to permit a sub-stantive review. An acknowledgment letter indicates that the ANDA is re-garded as received. \\nAct is the Federal Food, Drug, and \\nCosmetic Act (section 201 et seq. (21 \\nU.S.C. 301 et seq. )). \\nActive ingredient is any component \\nthat is intended to furnish pharma-cological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals. The term includes those components that may undergo chemical change in the manufacture of the drug product and be present in the drug product in a modified form intended to furnish the specified activity or effect. \\nActive moiety is the molecule or ion, \\nexcluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt (including a salt with hy-drogen or coordination bonds), or other noncovalent derivative (such as a com-plex, chelate, or clathrate) of the mol-ecule, responsible for the physiological \\nor pharmacological action of the drug substance. \\nANDA holder is the applicant that \\nowns an approved ANDA. \\nApplicant is any person who submits \\nan NDA (including a 505(b)(2) applica-tion) or ANDA or an amendment or supplement to an NDA or ANDA under this part to obtain FDA approval of a new drug and any person who owns an approved NDA (including a 505(b)(2) ap-plication) or ANDA. \\nApplication, new drug application, or \\nNDA is the application described under \\n§314.50, including all amendments and supplements to the application. An NDA refers to ‘‘stand-alone’’ applica-tions submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act and to 505(b)(2) applications. \\nApproval letter is a written commu-\\nnication to an applicant from FDA ap-proving an NDA or an ANDA. \\nAssess the effects of the change is to \\nevaluate the effects of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, qual-ity, purity, and potency of a drug prod-uct as these factors may relate to the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00105 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '91', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bioavailability may be assessed by scientifically valid measurements intended to reflect the rate and extent to which the active in-gredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action. \\nBioequivalence is the absence of a sig-\\nnificant difference in the rate and ex-tent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alter-natives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar condi-tions in an appropriately designed study. Where there is an intentional difference in rate (e.g., in certain ex-tended-release dosage forms), certain pharmaceutical equivalents or alter-natives may be considered bioequiva-lent if there is no significant difference in the extent to which the active ingre-dient or moiety from each product be-comes available at the site of drug ac-tion. This applies only if the difference in the rate at which the active ingre-dient or moiety becomes available at the site of drug action is intentional and is reflected in the proposed label-ing, is not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on chronic use, and is considered medi-cally insignificant for the drug. For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bio-equivalence may be assessed by sci-entifically valid measurements in-tended to reflect the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active \\nmoiety becomes available at the site of drug action. \\nBioequivalence requirement is a re-\\nquirement imposed by FDA for in vitro and/or in vivo testing of specified drug products that must be satisfied as a condition of marketing. \\nClass 1 resubmission is the resubmis-\\nsion of an NDA or efficacy supplement, following receipt of a complete re-sponse letter, that contains one or more of the following: Final printed la-beling, draft labeling, certain safety updates, stability updates to support provisional or final dating periods, commitments to perform post-marketing studies (including proposals for such studies), assay validation data, final release testing on the last lots used to support approval, minor reanalyses of previously submitted data, and other comparatively minor information. \\nClass 2 resubmission is the resubmis-\\nsion of an NDA or efficacy supplement, following receipt of a complete re-sponse letter, that includes any item not specified in the definition of ‘‘Class 1 resubmission,’’ including any item that would require presentation to an advisory committee. \\nCommercial marketing is the introduc-\\ntion or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a drug product described in an ANDA, outside the con-trol of the ANDA applicant, except that the term does not include transfer of the drug product for investigational use under part 312 of this chapter or transfer of the drug product to parties identified in the ANDA for reasons other than sale. Commercial mar-keting includes the introduction or de-livery for introduction into interstate commerce of the reference listed drug by the ANDA applicant. \\nComplete response letter is a written \\ncommunication to an applicant from FDA usually describing all of the defi-ciencies that the Agency has identified in an NDA or ANDA that must be satis-factorily addressed before it can be ap-proved. \\nComponent is any ingredient intended \\nfor use in the manufacture of a drug product, including those that may not appear in such drug product. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '92', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

A paragraph IV ac-knowledgment letter indicates that the 505(b)(2) application is regarded as filed or the ANDA is regarded as received. \\nParagraph IV certification is a patent \\ncertification of invalidity, unenforce-ability, or noninfringement described in §314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)( 4) or \\n§314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( 4). \\nPatent owner is the owner of the pat-\\nent for which information is submitted for an NDA. \\nPharmaceutical alternatives are drug \\nproducts that contain the identical therapeutic moiety, or its precursor, but not necessarily in the same amount or dosage form or as the same salt or ester. Each such drug product individually meets either the identical or its own respective compendial or other applicable standard of identity, strength, quality, and purity, including potency and, where applicable, content uniformity, disintegration times, and/ or dissolution rates. \\nPharmaceutical equivalents are drug \\nproducts in identical dosage forms and route(s) of administration that contain identical amounts of the identical ac-tive drug ingredient, i.e., the same salt \\nor ester of the same therapeutic moi-ety, or, in the case of modified-release dosage forms that require a reservoir or overage or such forms as prefilled syringes where residual volume may vary, that deliver identical amounts of the active drug ingredient over the identical dosing period; do not nec-essarily contain the same inactive in-gredients; and meet the identical compendial or other applicable stand-ard of identity, strength, quality, and purity, including potency and, where applicable, content uniformity, disinte-gration times, and/or dissolution rates. \\nPostmark is an independently \\nverifiable evidentiary record of the date on which a document is trans-mitted, in an unmodifiable format, to another party. For postmarks made by the U.S. Postal Service or a designated \\ndelivery service, the date of trans-mission is the date on which the docu-ment is received by the domestic mail service of the U.S. Postal Service or by a designated delivery service. For post-marks documenting an electronic event, the date of transmission is the date (in a particular time zone) that FDA sends the electronic transmission on its host system as evidenced by a verifiable record. If the sender and the intended recipient are located in dif-ferent time zones, it is the sender’s time zone that provides the controlling date of electronic transmission. \\nReference listed drug is the listed drug \\nidentified by FDA as the drug product upon which an applicant relies in seek-ing approval of its ANDA. \\nReference standard is the drug product \\nselected by FDA that an applicant seeking approval of an ANDA must use in conducting an in vivo bioequiva-lence study required for approval. \\nResubmission, in the context of a com-\\nplete response letter, is submission by the applicant of all materials needed to fully address all deficiencies identified in the complete response letter. An NDA or ANDA for which FDA issued a complete response letter, but which was withdrawn before approval and later submitted again, is not a resub-mission. \\nRight of reference or use is the author-\\nity to rely upon, and otherwise use, an investigation for the purpose of obtain-ing approval of an NDA, including the ability to make available the under-lying raw data from the investigation for FDA audit, if necessary. \\nSame drug product formulation is the \\nformulation of the drug product sub-mitted for approval and any formula-tions that have minor differences in composition or method of manufacture from the formulation submitted for ap-proval, but are similar enough to be relevant to the Agency’s determination of bioequivalence. \\nSpecification is the quality standard \\n(i.e., tests, analytical procedures, and \\nacceptance criteria) provided in an ap-proved NDA or ANDA to confirm the quality of drug substances, drug prod-ucts, intermediates, raw materials, re-agents, components, in-process mate-rials, container closure systems, and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00108 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '94', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Barring unforeseen cir-cumstances, tabulations agreed to be deleted at such a conference will not be requested during the conduct of FDA’s review of the NDA. If such unforeseen circumstances do occur, any request for deleted tabulations will be made by the director of the FDA division re-sponsible for reviewing the NDA, in ac-cordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this section. \\n(2) Case report forms. The NDA is re-\\nquired to contain copies of individual case report forms for each patient who died during a clinical study or who did not complete the study because of an adverse event, whether believed to be drug related or not, including patients receiving reference drugs or placebo. This requirement may be waived by FDA for specific studies if the case re-port forms are unnecessary for a proper review of the study. \\n(3) Additional data. The applicant \\nmust submit to FDA additional case report forms and tabulations needed to conduct a proper review of the NDA, as requested by the director of the FDA division responsible for reviewing the NDA. The applicant’s failure to submit information requested by FDA within 30 days after receipt of the request may result in the agency viewing any even-tual submission as a major amendment under §314.60 and extending the review period as necessary. If desired by the applicant, the FDA division director will verify in writing any request for additional data that was made orally. \\n(4) Presentation and format. Appli-\\ncants are invited to meet with FDA be-fore submitting an NDA to discuss the presentation and format of supporting information. If the applicant and FDA agree, the applicant may submit tab-ulations of patient data and case report forms in an alternate form. \\n(g) Other. The following general re-\\nquirements apply to the submission of information within the summary under paragraph (c) of this section and within \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00115 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '101', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

A reference to information submitted previously is required to identify the file by name, reference number, vol-ume, and page number in the agency’s records where the information can be found. A reference to information sub-mitted to the agency by a person other than the applicant is required to con-tain a written statement that author-izes the reference and that is signed by the person who submitted the informa-tion. \\n(2) The applicant must submit an ac-\\ncurate and complete English trans-lation of each part of the NDA that is not in English. The applicant must submit a copy of each original lit-erature publication for which an English translation is submitted. \\n(3) If an applicant who submits an \\nNDA under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act obtains a ‘‘right of reference or use,’’ as defined under §314.3(b), to an investigation de-scribed in clause (A) of section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act, the applicant must include in its NDA a written statement signed by the owner of the data from each such investigation that the applicant may rely on in support of the approval of its NDA, and provide FDA access to, the underlying raw data that provide the basis for the report of the inves-tigation submitted in its NDA. \\n(h) Patent information. The NDA is re-\\nquired to contain the patent informa-tion described under §314.53. \\n(i) Patent certification —(1) Contents. A \\n505(b)(2) application is required to con-tain the following: \\n(i) Patents claiming drug substance, \\ndrug product, or method of use. (A) An \\nappropriate patent certification or statement with respect to each patent issued by the U.S. Patent and Trade-mark Office that, in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowl-edge, claims the drug substance or drug product on which investigations that are relied upon by the applicant for ap-proval of its 505(b)(2) application were conducted or that claims an approved use for such drug and for which infor-\\nmation is required to be filed under section 505(b) and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and §314.53. For each such patent, the ap-plicant must provide the patent num-ber and certify, in its opinion and to the best of its knowledge, one of the following circumstances: \\n(1) That the patent information has \\nnot been submitted to FDA. The appli-cant must entitle such a certification ‘‘Paragraph I Certification’’; \\n(2) That the patent has expired. The \\napplicant must entitle such a certifi-cation ‘‘Paragraph II Certification’’; \\n(3) The date on which the patent will \\nexpire. The applicant must entitle such a certification ‘‘Paragraph III Certifi-cation’’; or \\n(4)(i) That the patent is invalid, un-\\nenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the 505(b)(2) ap-plication is submitted.

If, in the opin-\\nion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge, there are no patents de-\\nscribed in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this sec-tion, a certification in the following form: \\nIn the opinion and to the best knowledge of \\n(name of applicant ), there are no patents that \\nclaim the drug or drugs on which investiga-tions that are relied upon in this 505(b)(2) ap-plication were conducted or that claim a use of such drug or drugs. \\n(iii) Method-of-use patent. (A) If infor-\\nmation that is submitted under section 505(b) or (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and §314.53 is for a method-of-use patent, and the labeling for the drug product for which the ap-plicant is seeking approval does not in-clude an indication or other condition of use that is covered by the method- of-use patent, a statement explaining that the method-of-use patent does not claim a proposed indication or other condition of use. \\n(B) If the labeling of the drug product \\nfor which the applicant is seeking ap-proval includes an indication or other condition of use that, according to the patent information submitted under section 505(b) or (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and §314.53 or in the opinion of the appli-cant, is claimed by a method-of-use patent, the applicant must submit an applicable certification under para-graph (i)(1)(i) of this section. \\n(2) [Reserved] (3) Licensing agreements. If a 505(b)(2) \\napplication is submitted for a drug or method of using a drug claimed by a patent and the applicant has a licens-ing agreement with the patent owner, the applicant must submit a paragraph \\nIV certification as to that patent and a statement that the applicant has been granted a patent license. If the patent owner consents to approval of the 505(b)(2) application (if otherwise eligi-ble for approval) as of a specific date, the 505(b)(2) application must contain a written statement from the patent owner that it has a licensing agree-ment with the applicant and that it consents to approval of the 505(b)(2) ap-plication as of a specific date. \\n(4) Untimely filing of patent informa-\\ntion. (i) If a patent described in para-\\ngraph (i)(1)(i)(A) of this section is issued and the holder of the approved NDA for the patented drug does not file with FDA the required information on the patent within 30 days of issuance of the patent, an applicant who submitted a 505(b)(2) application that, before the submission of the patent information, contained an appropriate patent cer-tification or statement is not required to submit a patent certification or statement to address the patent or pat-ent information that is late-listed with respect to the pending 505(b)(2) applica-tion. Except as provided in §314.53(f)(1), an NDA holder’s amendment to the de-scription of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent will be con-sidered untimely filing of patent infor-mation unless: \\n(A) The amendment to the descrip-\\ntion of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of patent issuance; \\n(B) The amendment to the descrip-\\ntion of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of approval of a cor-responding change to product labeling; or \\n(C) The amendment to the descrip-\\ntion of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or by a Federal district court, the Court of Ap-peals for the Federal Circuit, or the U.S. Supreme Court that is specific to the patent and alters the construction of a method-of-use claim(s) of the pat-ent, and the amendment contains a copy of the decision. \\n(ii) An applicant whose 505(b)(2) ap-\\nplication is submitted after the NDA \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00117 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '103', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

If an \\napplicant disputes the accuracy or rel-evance of patent information sub-mitted to FDA, the applicant may seek a confirmation of the correctness of the patent information in accordance with the procedures under §314.53(f). Unless the patent information is with-drawn, the applicant must submit an appropriate certification or statement for each listed patent. \\n(6) Amended certifications. A patent \\ncertification or statement submitted under paragraphs (i)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section may be amended at any time before the approval of the 505(b)(2) application. An applicant must submit an amended certification as an amend-ment to a pending 505(b)(2) application. If an applicant with a pending 505(b)(2) application voluntarily makes a patent certification for an untimely filed pat-ent, the applicant may withdraw the patent certification for the untimely filed patent. Once an amendment is submitted to change the certification, the 505(b)(2) application will no longer be considered to contain the prior cer-tification. \\n(i) After finding of infringement. An ap-\\nplicant who has submitted a paragraph IV certification and is sued for patent infringement must submit an amend-ment to change its certification if a court enters a final decision from which no appeal has been or can be taken, or signs and enters a settlement order or consent decree in the action that includes a finding that the patent is infringed, unless the final decision, settlement order, or consent decree also finds the patent to be invalid. In its amendment, the applicant must cer-tify under paragraph (i)(1)(i)(A)( 3) of \\nthis section that the patent will expire on a specific date or, with respect to a patent claiming a method of use, the applicant may instead provide a state-ment under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section if the applicant amends its \\n505(b)(2) application such that the ap-plicant is no longer seeking approval for a method of use claimed by the pat-ent. Once an amendment for the change has been submitted, the 505(b)(2) application will no longer be considered to contain a paragraph IV certification to the patent. If a final decision finds the patent to be invalid and infringed, an amended certification is not required. \\n(ii) After request to remove a patent or \\npatent information from the list. If the \\nlist reflects that an NDA holder has re-quested that a patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list and no ANDA applicant is eligible for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that patent, the patent or patent information will be removed and any applicant with a pending 505(b)(2) application (including a ten-tatively approved 505(b)(2) application) who has made a certification with re-spect to such patent must submit an amendment to withdraw its certifi-cation. In the amendment, the appli-\\ncant must state the reason for with-drawing the certification or statement (that the patent has been removed from the list). If the list reflects that an NDA holder has requested that a patent or patent information be re-moved from the list and one or more first applicants are eligible for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that patent, the patent will remain listed until any 180-day ex-clusivity based on that patent has ex-pired or has been extinguished. A 505(b)(2) applicant is not required to provide or maintain a certification to a patent or patent information that re-mains listed only for purposes of a first applicant’s 180-day exclusivity for its ANDA. Once an amendment to with-draw the certification has been sub-mitted, the 505(b)(2) application will no longer be considered to contain a para-graph IV certification to the patent. If removal of a patent from the list re-sults in there being no patents listed for the listed drug(s) identified in the 505(b)(2) application, the applicant must submit an amended certification reflecting that there are no listed pat-ents. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00118 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '104', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(A) Except as \\nprovided in paragraphs (i)(4) and (i)(6)(iii)(B) of this section: \\n(1) An applicant must amend a sub-\\nmitted certification or statement if, at any time before the approval of the 505(b)(2) application, the applicant learns that the submitted certification or statement is no longer accurate; and \\n(2) An applicant must submit an ap-\\npropriate patent certification or state-ment under paragraph (i)(1) of this sec-tion if, after submission of the 505(b)(2) application, a new patent is issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that, in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge, claims a listed drug relied upon or that claims an approved use for such listed drug for which information is required to be filed under section 505(b) and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act and §314.53. \\n(B) An applicant is not required to \\nsubmit a supplement to change a sub-mitted certification when information on an otherwise applicable patent is submitted after the approval of the 505(b)(2) application. \\n(j) Claimed exclusivity. A new drug \\nproduct, upon approval, may be enti-\\ntled to a period of marketing exclu-sivity under the provisions of §314.108. If an applicant believes its drug prod-uct is entitled to a period of exclu-sivity, it must submit with the NDA prior to approval the following infor-mation: \\n(1) A statement that the applicant is \\nclaiming exclusivity. \\n(2) A reference to the appropriate \\nparagraph under §314.108 that supports its claim. \\n(3) If the applicant claims exclusivity \\nunder §314.108(b)(2), information to show that, to the best of its knowledge or belief, a drug has not previously been approved under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act containing any active moiety in the drug for which the applicant is seeking approval. \\n(4) If the applicant claims exclusivity \\nunder §314.108(b)(4) or (b)(5), the fol-lowing information to show that the NDA contains ‘‘new clinical investiga-tions’’ that are ‘‘essential to approval of the NDA or supplement’’ and were ‘‘conducted or sponsored by the appli-\\ncant:’’ \\n(i) ‘‘New clinical investigations. ’’ A cer-\\ntification that to the best of the appli-cant’s knowledge each of the clinical investigations included in the NDA meets the definition of ‘‘new clinical investigation’’ set forth in §314.108(a). \\n(ii) ‘‘Essential to approval.’’ A list of \\nall published studies or publicly avail-able reports of clinical investigations known to the applicant through a lit-erature search that are relevant to the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval, a certification that the applicant has thoroughly searched the scientific literature and, to the best of the applicant’s knowledge, the list is complete and accurate and, in the applicant’s opinion, such published studies or publicly available reports do not provide a sufficient basis for the approval of the conditions for which the applicant is seeking approval with-out reference to the new clinical inves-tigation(s) in the NDA, and an expla-nation as to why the studies or reports are insufficient. \\n(iii) ‘‘Conducted or sponsored by.’’ If \\nthe applicant was the sponsor named in the Form FDA 1571 for an IND under which the new clinical investigation(s) that is essential to the approval of its NDA was conducted, identification of the IND by number. If the applicant was not the sponsor of the IND under which the clinical investigation(s) was conducted, a certification that the ap-plicant or its predecessor in interest provided substantial support for the clinical investigation(s) that is essen-tial to the approval of its NDA, and in-formation supporting the certification. To demonstrate ‘‘substantial support,’’ an applicant must either provide a cer-tified statement from a certified public accountant that the applicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of con-ducting the study or provide an expla-nation of why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or spon-sored the study if the applicant’s finan-cial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the investigational new drug.

      "page_content='113 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 314.53 \\n(b) Patents for which information must \\nbe submitted and patents for which infor-mation must not be submitted —(1) General \\nrequirements. An applicant described in \\nparagraph (a) of this section must sub-mit to its NDA the required informa-tion, on the required FDA declaration form, set forth in paragraph (c) of this section for each patent that claims the drug or a method of using the drug that is the subject of the NDA or amend-ment or supplement to it and with re-spect to which a claim of patent in-fringement could reasonably be as-serted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product. For purposes of this part, such patents consist of drug substance (ac-tive ingredient) patents, drug product (formulation and composition) patents, and method-of-use patents. For patents that claim the drug substance, the ap-plicant must submit information only on those patents that claim the drug substance that is the subject of the pending or approved NDA or that claim a drug substance that is the same as the active ingredient that is the sub-ject of the approved or pending NDA. For patents that claim only a poly-morph that is the same as the active ingredient described in the approved or pending NDA, the applicant must cer-tify in the required FDA declaration form that the applicant has test data, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, demonstrating that a drug product containing the polymorph will perform the same as the drug product described in the NDA. For patents that claim a drug product, the applicant must submit information only on those patents that claim the drug product, as is defined in §314.3, that is described in the pending or approved NDA. For pat-ents that claim a method of use, the applicant must submit information only on those patents that claim indi-cations or other conditions of use for which approval is sought or has been granted in the NDA. The applicant must separately identify each pending or approved method of use and related patent claim(s). For approved NDAs, the NDA holder’s description of the patented method of use required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(P)( 3) of this section \\nmust describe only the approved meth-od(s) of use claimed by the patent for \\nwhich a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product. If the meth-od(s) of use claimed by the patent does not cover an indication or other ap-proved condition of use in its entirety, the applicant must describe only the specific approved method of use claimed by the patent for which a claim of patent infringement could rea-sonably be asserted if a person not li-censed by the owner of the patent en-gaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product. For approved NDAs, the NDA holder submitting in-formation on the method-of-use patent must identify with specificity the sec-tion(s) and subsection(s) of the ap-proved labeling that describes the method(s) of use claimed by the patent submitted. Process patents, patents claiming packaging, patents claiming metabolites, and patents claiming intermediates are not covered by this section, and information on these pat-ents must not be submitted to FDA. \\n(2) Test data for submission of patent \\ninformation for patents that claim only a polymorph. The test data, referenced in \\nparagraph (b)(1) of this section, must include the following: \\n(i) A full description of the poly-\\nmorphic form of the drug substance, in-cluding its physical and chemical char-acteristics and stability; the method of synthesis (or isolation) and purifi-cation of the drug substance; the proc-ess controls used during manufacture and packaging; and such specifications and analytical methods as are nec-essary to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the polymorphic form of the drug substance; \\n(ii) The executed batch record for a \\ndrug product containing the poly-morphic form of the drug substance and documentation that the batch was manufactured under current good man-ufacturing practice requirements; \\n(iii) Demonstration of bioequivalence \\nbetween the executed batch of the drug product that contains the polymorphic form of the drug substance and the drug product as described in the NDA; \\n(iv) A list of all components used in \\nthe manufacture of the drug product \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00123 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '109', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

FDA will publish \\nsuch patent information upon approval of the NDA, or, if the patent informa-tion is submitted by the applicant after approval of an NDA as provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as soon as possible after the submission to the Agency of the patent information. A request for copies of the submitted pat-ent information must be sent in writ-ing to the Freedom of Information Staff at the address listed on the Agen-cy’s Web site at http://www.fda.gov . The \\nsubmitted patent information, and re-quests to remove a patent or patent in-formation from the list, may be subject to public disclosure. \\n(f) Correction of patent information er-\\nrors—(1) Requests by persons other than \\nthe NDA holder. If any person disputes \\nthe accuracy or relevance of patent in-formation submitted to the Agency under this section and published by FDA in the list, or believes that an NDA holder has failed to submit re-quired patent information, that person must first notify the Agency in a writ-ten or electronic communication titled ‘‘314.53(f) Patent Listing Dispute.’’ The patent listing dispute communication must include a statement of dispute that describes the specific grounds for disagreement regarding the accuracy or relevance of patent information for FDA to send to the applicable NDA holder. For a dispute regarding the ac-curacy or relevance of patent informa-tion regarding an approved method of using the drug product, this statement of dispute must be only a narrative de-scription (no more than 250 words) of the person’s interpretation of the scope of the patent. This statement of dis-pute must only contain information for which the person consents to disclosure because FDA will send the text of the statement to the applicable NDA hold-er without review or redaction. The patent listing dispute communication should be directed to the Central Docu-\\nment Room, Attn: Orange Book Staff, Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search, Food and Drug Administration, 5901–B Ammendale Rd., Beltsville, MD 20705–1266, or to the Orange Book Staff at the email address listed on the Agency’s Web site at http:// \\nwww.fda.gov . \\n(i) Communication with the NDA hold-\\ner—(A) Drug substance or drug product \\nclaim. For requests submitted under \\nthis paragraph (f)(1) that are directed to the accuracy or relevance of sub-mitted patent information regarding a drug substance or drug product claim, the Agency will send the statement of dispute to the applicable NDA holder. The NDA holder must confirm the cor-rectness of the patent information and include the signed verification required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(R) of this sec-tion or withdraw or amend the patent information in accordance with para-graph (f)(2) of this section within 30 days of the date on which the Agency sends the statement of dispute. Unless the NDA holder withdraws or amends its patent information in response to the patent listing dispute, the Agency will not change the patent information in the Orange Book. \\n(B) Method-of-use claim. For requests \\nsubmitted under this paragraph (f)(1) that are directed to the accuracy or relevance of submitted patent informa-tion regarding an approved method of using the drug product, FDA will send the statement of dispute to the NDA holder.

The narrative description must only contain information for which the NDA holder consents to dis-closure because FDA will send the text of the statement to the person who submitted the patent listing dispute without review or redaction. \\n(1) If the NDA holder confirms the \\ncorrectness of the patent information, provides the narrative description re-quired by paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and includes the signed verification required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(R) of this section within 30 days of the date on which the Agency sends the statement of dispute, the Agency will not change the patent in-formation in the Orange Book. \\n(2) If the NDA holder responds to the \\npatent listing dispute with amended patent information in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section, pro-vides the narrative description re-quired by paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and includes the signed verification required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(R) of this section within 30 days of the date on which the Agency sends the statement of dispute, FDA will update the Orange Book to reflect the amended patent information. \\n(ii) Patent certification or statement \\nduring and after patent listing dispute. A \\n505(b)(2) application or ANDA must contain an appropriate certification or statement for each listed patent, in-cluding the disputed patent, during and after the patent listing dispute. \\n(iii) Information on patent listing dis-\\nputes. FDA will promptly post informa-\\ntion on its Web site regarding whether a patent listing dispute has been sub-mitted for a published description of a patented method of use for a drug prod-uct and whether the NDA holder has timely responded to the patent listing dispute. \\n(2) Requests by the NDA holder —(i) \\nPatents or patent claims that no longer meet the statutory requirements for list-ing. If the NDA holder determines that \\na patent or patent claim no longer meets the requirements for listing in section 505(b)(1) or (c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (includ-ing if there has been a judicial finding of invalidity for a listed patent, from \\nwhich no appeal has been or can be taken), the NDA holder is required to promptly notify FDA to amend the patent information or withdraw the patent or patent information and re-quest that the patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list. If the NDA holder is required by court order to amend patent information or with-draw a patent from the list, it must submit an amendment to its NDA that includes a copy of the order, within 14 days of the date the order was entered, to the Central Document Room, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 5901–B Ammendale Rd., Beltsville, MD 20705– 1266. The amendment to the NDA must bear the identification described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. FDA will remove a patent or patent infor-mation from the list if there is no first applicant eligible for 180-day exclu-sivity based on a paragraph IV certifi-cation to that patent or after the 180- day exclusivity period of a first appli-cant based on that patent has expired or has been extinguished. \\n(ii) Patent term restoration. If the term \\nof a listed patent is extended pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 156(e), the NDA holder must submit on Form FDA 3542 a cor-rection to the expiration date of the patent. This correction must be sub-mitted within 30 days of receipt of a certificate of extension as described in 35 U.S.C. 156(e)(1) or documentation of an extension of the term of the patent as described in 35 U.S.C. 156(e)(2). \\n(iii) Submission of corrections or \\nchanges to patent information. Correc-\\ntions or changes to previously sub-mitted patent information, other than withdrawal of a patent and requests to remove a patent from the list, must be submitted on Form FDA 3542 or 3542a, as appropriate, in an amendment or supplement to the NDA. The amend-ment or supplement to the NDA must bear the identification described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.

Where the course of the disease and the effects of the drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric pa-tients, FDA may conclude that pedi-atric effectiveness can be extrapolated from adequate and well-controlled studies in adults usually supplemented with other information obtained in pe-diatric patients, such as pharmaco-kinetic studies. Studies may not be needed in each pediatric age group, if data from one age group can be extrap-olated to another. Assessments of safe-ty and effectiveness required under this section for a drug product that rep-resents a meaningful therapeutic ben-efit over existing treatments for pedi-atric patients must be carried out using appropriate formulations for each age group(s) for which the assess-ment is required. \\n(b) Deferred submission. (1) FDA may, \\non its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, defer submission of some or all assessments of safety and effectiveness described in paragraph (a) of this section until after approval of the drug product for use in adults. De-ferral may be granted if, among other reasons, the drug is ready for approval in adults before studies in pediatric pa-tients are complete, or pediatric stud-ies should be delayed until additional safety or effectiveness data have been collected. If an applicant requests de-ferred submission, the request must provide a certification from the appli-cant of the grounds for delaying pedi-atric studies, a description of the planned or ongoing studies, and evi-dence that the studies are being or will be conducted with due diligence and at the earliest possible time. \\n(2) If FDA determines that there is \\nan adequate justification for tempo-rarily delaying the submission of as-sessments of pediatric safety and effec-tiveness, the drug product may be ap-proved for use in adults subject to the requirement that the applicant submit the required assessments within a spec-ified time. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00132 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '118', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

FDA may \\ngrant a full or partial waiver of the re-quirements of paragraph (a) of this sec-tion on its own initiative or at the re-quest of an applicant. A request for a waiver must provide an adequate jus-tification. \\n(2) Full waiver. An applicant may re-\\nquest a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the ap-plicant certifies that: \\n(i) The drug product does not rep-\\nresent a meaningful therapeutic ben-efit over existing treatments for pedi-atric patients and is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pedi-atric patients; \\n(ii) Necessary studies are impossible \\nor highly impractical because, e.g., the number of such patients is so small or geographically dispersed; or \\n(iii) There is evidence strongly sug-\\ngesting that the drug product would be ineffective or unsafe in all pediatric age groups. \\n(3) Partial waiver. An applicant may \\nrequest a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with re-spect to a specified pediatric age group, if the applicant certifies that: \\n(i) The drug product does not rep-\\nresent a meaningful therapeutic ben-efit over existing treatments for pedi-atric patients in that age group, and is not likely to be used in a substantial number of patients in that age group; \\n(ii) Necessary studies are impossible \\nor highly impractical because, e.g., the number of patients in that age group is so small or geographically dispersed; \\n(iii) There is evidence strongly sug-\\ngesting that the drug product would be ineffective or unsafe in that age group; or \\n(iv) The applicant can demonstrate \\nthat reasonable attempts to produce a pediatric formulation necessary for that age group have failed. \\n(4) FDA action on waiver. FDA shall \\ngrant a full or partial waiver, as appro-priate, if the agency finds that there is a reasonable basis on which to con-clude that one or more of the grounds for waiver specified in paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section have been met. If a waiver is granted on the ground that it is not possible to develop a pedi-atric formulation, the waiver will cover only those pediatric age groups requiring that formulation. If a waiver \\nis granted because there is evidence that the product would be ineffective or unsafe in pediatric populations, this information will be included in the product’s labeling. \\n(5) Definition of ‘‘meaningful thera-\\npeutic benefit’’. For purposes of this sec-\\ntion and §201.23 of this chapter, a drug will be considered to offer a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing thera-pies if FDA estimates that: \\n(i) If approved, the drug would rep-\\nresent a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, compared to marketed products adequately labeled for that \\nuse in the relevant pediatric popu-lation. Examples of how improvement might be demonstrated include, for ex-ample, evidence of increased effective-ness in treatment, prevention, or diag-nosis of disease, elimination or sub-stantial reduction of a treatment-lim-iting drug reaction, documented en-hancement of compliance, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation; or \\n(ii) The drug is in a class of drugs or \\nfor an indication for which there is a need for additional therapeutic op-tions. \\n(d) Exemption for orphan drugs.

FDA may, at its discretion, re-view such an amendment during the initial review cycle or defer review until the subsequent review cycle. \\n(4) Submission of a major amend-\\nment to a manufacturing supplement within 2 months of the end of the ini-tial review cycle constitutes an agree-ment by the applicant under section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to extend the initial re-view cycle by 2 months. FDA may in-stead defer review of the amendment until the subsequent review cycle. If the agency extends the initial review \\ncycle for a manufacturing supplement under this paragraph, the division re-sponsible for reviewing the supplement will notify the applicant of the exten-sion. The initial review cycle for a manufacturing supplement may be ex-tended only once due to submission of a major amendment. FDA may, at its discretion, review any subsequent major amendment during the initial review cycle (as extended) or defer re-view until the subsequent review cycle. \\n(5) Submission of an amendment to a \\nsupplement other than an efficacy or manufacturing supplement will not ex-tend the initial review cycle. FDA may, at its discretion, review such an amendment during the initial review cycle or defer review until the subse-quent review cycle. \\n(6) A major amendment may not in-\\nclude data to support an indication or claim that was not included in the original NDA, supplement, or resub-mission, but it may include data to support a minor modification of an in-dication or claim that was included in the original NDA, supplement, or re-submission. \\n(7) When FDA defers review of an \\namendment until the subsequent re-view cycle, the agency will notify the applicant of the deferral in the com-plete response letter sent to the appli-cant under §314.110 of this part. \\n(c) Limitation on certain amend-\\nments.

An applicant may \\nnot amend a 505(b)(2) application to seek approval of a drug that is a dif-ferent drug from the drug in the origi-nal submission of the 505(b)(2) applica-tion. For purposes of this paragraph (e), a drug is a different drug if it has been modified to have a different ac-tive ingredient, different route of ad-ministration, different dosage form, or difference in excipients that requires either a separate clinical study to es-tablish safety or effectiveness or, for topical products, that requires a sepa-rate in vivo demonstration of bio-equivalence. However, notwithstanding the limitation described in this para-graph (e), an applicant may amend the 505(b)(2) application to seek approval of a different strength. \\n(f) Patent certification requirements. (1) \\nAn amendment to a 505(b)(2) applica-tion is required to contain an appro-priate patent certification or state-ment described in §314.50(i) or a recer-tification for a previously submitted paragraph IV certification if approval is sought for any of the following types of amendments: \\n(i) To add a new indication or other \\ncondition of use; \\n(ii) To add a new strength; (iii) To make other than minor \\nchanges in product formulation; or \\n(iv) To change the physical form or \\ncrystalline structure of the active in-gredient. (2) If the amendment to the 505(b)(2) \\napplication does not contain a patent certification or statement, the appli-cant must verify that the proposed change described in the amendment is not one of the types of amendments de-scribed in paragraph (f)(1) of this sec-\\ntion. \\n[50 FR 7493, Feb. 22, 1985, as amended at 57 \\nFR 17983, Apr. 28, 1992; 58 FR 47352, Sept. 8, 1993; 63 FR 5252, Feb. 2, 1998; 69 FR 18764, Apr. 8, 2004; 73 FR 39608, July 10, 2008; 81 FR 69648, Oct. 6, 2016] \\n§ 314.65 Withdrawal by the applicant \\nof an unapproved application. \\nAn applicant may at any time with-\\ndraw an application that is not yet ap-proved by notifying the Food and Drug Administration in writing.

Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. \\nUnexpected adverse drug experience. \\nAny adverse drug experience that is not listed in the current labeling for the drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, but differ from the event because of greater se-verity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thrombo-embolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. ‘‘Unex-pected,’’ as used in this definition, re-fers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed ( i.e., \\nincluded in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharma-cological properties of the pharma-ceutical product. \\n(b) Review of adverse drug experiences. \\nEach applicant having an approved ap-plication under §314.50 or, in the case of a 505(b)(2) application, an effective approved application, must promptly review all adverse drug experience in-formation obtained or otherwise re-ceived by the applicant from any source, foreign or domestic, including information derived from commercial marketing experience, postmarketing clinical investigations, postmarketing epidemiological/surveillance studies, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers. Appli-cants are not required to resubmit to FDA adverse drug experience reports forwarded to the applicant by FDA; however, applicants must submit all followup information on such reports to FDA. Any person subject to the re-\\nporting requirements under paragraph (c) of this section must also develop written procedures for the surveillance, receipt, evaluation, and reporting of postmarketing adverse drug experi-ences to FDA. \\n(c) Reporting requirements. The appli-\\ncant must submit to FDA adverse drug experience information as described in this section. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, these reports must be submitted to the Agen-cy in electronic format as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. \\n(1)(i) Postmarketing 15-day ‘‘Alert re-\\nports’’. The applicant must report each \\nadverse drug experience that is both se-rious and unexpected, whether foreign or domestic, as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days from initial receipt of the information by the appli-cant. \\n(ii) Postmarketing 15-day ‘‘Alert re-\\nports’’—followup. The applicant must \\npromptly investigate all adverse drug experiences that are the subject of these postmarketing 15-day Alert re-ports and must submit followup reports within 15 calendar days of receipt of new information or as requested by FDA. If additional information is not obtainable, records should be main-tained of the unsuccessful steps taken to seek additional information. \\n(iii) Submission of reports. The re-\\nquirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, concerning the submission of postmarketing 15-day Alert reports, also apply to any person other than the applicant whose name appears on the label of an approved drug product as a manufacturer, pack-er, or distributor (nonapplicant). To avoid unnecessary duplication in the submission to FDA of reports required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section, obligations of a non-applicant may be met by submission of all reports of serious adverse drug ex-periences to the applicant. If a non-applicant elects to submit adverse drug experience reports to the applicant rather than to FDA, the nonapplicant must submit, by any appropriate means, each report to the applicant within 5 calendar days of initial receipt of the information by the non-applicant, and the applicant must then \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00141 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '127', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Under this circumstance, the nonapplicant must maintain a record of this action which must include: \\n(A) A copy of each adverse drug expe-\\nrience report; \\n(B) The date the report was received \\nby the nonapplicant; \\n(C) The date the report was sub-\\nmitted to the applicant; and \\n(D) The name and address of the ap-\\nplicant. \\n(2) Periodic adverse drug experience re-\\nports. (i) The applicant must report \\neach adverse drug experience not re-ported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this \\nsection at quarterly intervals, for 3 years from the date of approval of the application, and then at annual inter-vals. The applicant must submit each quarterly report within 30 days of the close of the quarter (the first quarter beginning on the date of approval of the application) and each annual report within 60 days of the anniversary date of approval of the application. Upon written notice, FDA may extend or re-establish the requirement that an ap-plicant submit quarterly reports, or re-quire that the applicant submit reports under this section at different times than those stated. For example, the agency may reestablish a quarterly re-porting requirement following the ap-proval of a major supplement. Fol-lowup information to adverse drug ex-periences submitted in a periodic re-port may be submitted in the next peri-odic report. \\n(ii) Each periodic report is required \\nto contain: \\n(A) Descriptive information. (1) A nar-\\nrative summary and analysis of the in-formation in the report; \\n(2) An analysis of the 15-day Alert re-\\nports submitted during the reporting interval (all 15-day Alert reports being appropriately referenced by the appli-cant’s patient identification code, ad-verse reaction term(s), and date of sub-mission to FDA); \\n(3) A history of actions taken since \\nthe last report because of adverse drug experiences (for example, labeling changes or studies initiated); and \\n(4) An index consisting of a line list-\\ning of the applicant’s patient identi-fication code, and adverse reaction term(s) for all ICSRs submitted under \\nparagraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section. \\n(B) ICSRs for serious, expected, and \\nnonserious adverse drug experiences. An \\nICSR for each adverse drug experience not reported under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (all serious, expected and nonserious adverse drug experi-ences). All such ICSRs must be sub-mitted to FDA (either individually or in one or more batches) within the timeframe specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. ICSRs must only be submitted to FDA once. \\n(iii) Periodic reporting, except for in-\\nformation regarding 15-day Alert re-ports, does not apply to adverse drug experience information obtained from postmarketing studies (whether or not conducted under an investigational new drug application), from reports in the scientific literature, and from for-eign marketing experience. \\n(d) Scientific literature. A 15-day Alert \\nreport based on information in the sci-entific literature must be accompanied by a copy of the published article. The 15-day reporting requirements in para-graph (c)(1)(i) of this section ( i.e., seri-\\nous, unexpected adverse drug experi-ences) apply only to reports found in scientific and medical journals either as case reports or as the result of a for-mal clinical trial. \\n(e) Postmarketing studies. An applicant \\nis not required to submit a 15-day Alert report under paragraph (c) of this sec-tion for an adverse drug experience ob-tained from a postmarketing study (whether or not conducted under an in-vestigational new drug application) un-less the applicant concludes that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse experience. \\n(f) Information reported on ICSRs. \\nICSRs include the following informa-tion: \\n(1) Patient information. \\n(i) Patient identification code; (ii) Patient age at the time of adverse \\ndrug experience, or date of birth; \\n(iii) Patient gender; and (iv) Patient weight.

FDA will issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, preparation and organiza-tion of files). \\n(2) An applicant or nonapplicant may \\nrequest, in writing, a temporary waiver of the requirements in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. These waivers will be granted on a limited basis for good cause shown. FDA will issue guidance on requesting a waiver of the require-ments in paragraph (g)(1) of this sec-tion. \\n(h) Multiple reports. An applicant \\nshould not include in reports under this section any adverse drug experi-ences that occurred in clinical trials if they were previously submitted as part of the approved application. If a report applies to a drug for which an appli-cant holds more than one approved ap-plication, the applicant should submit the report to the application that was first approved. If a report refers to more than one drug marketed by an ap-plicant, the applicant should submit the report to the application for the drug listed first in the report. \\n(i) Patient privacy. An applicant \\nshould not include in reports under this section the names and addresses of individual patients; instead, the appli-cant should assign a unique code for identification of the patient. The appli-cant should include the name of the re-porter from whom the information was received as part of the initial reporter information, even when the reporter is the patient. The names of patients, health care professionals, hospitals, and geographical identifiers in adverse drug experience reports are not releas-able to the public under FDA’s public information regulations in part 20 of this chapter. \\n(j) Recordkeeping. The applicant must \\nmaintain for a period of 10 years records of all adverse drug experiences known to the applicant, including raw data and any correspondence relating to adverse drug experiences. \\n(k) Withdrawal of approval.

The applicant shall \\nsubmit each year within 60 days of the anniversary date of U.S. approval of the application, two copies of the re-port to the FDA division responsible for reviewing the application. Each an-nual report is required to be accom-panied by a completed transmittal Form FDA 2252 (Transmittal of Peri-odic Reports for Drugs for Human Use), and must include all the information required under this section that the ap-plicant received or otherwise obtained during the annual reporting interval that ends on the U.S. anniversary date. The report is required to contain in the order listed: \\n(i) Summary. A brief summary of sig-\\nnificant new information from the pre-vious year that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the drug product. The report is also required to contain a brief description of actions the applicant has taken or intends to take as a result of this new informa-tion, for example, submit a labeling supplement, add a warning to the label-ing, or initiate a new study.

Copies \\nof the label and all labeling for the drug product including, if applicable, any Medication Guide required under part 208 of this chapter (4 copies of draft labeling or 12 copies of final printed labeling). \\n(iii) Statement on proposed labeling. A \\nstatement that the applicant’s pro-posed labeling including, if applicable, any Medication Guide required under part 208 of this chapter is the same as the labeling of the reference listed drug except for differences annotated and explained under paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section. \\n(iv) Comparison of approved and pro-\\nposed labeling. A side-by-side compari-\\nson of the applicant’s proposed labeling including, if applicable, any Medica-tion Guide required under part 208 of this chapter with the approved labeling for the reference listed drug with all differences annotated and explained. Labeling (including the container label, package insert, and, if applica-ble, Medication Guide) proposed for the drug product must be the same as the labeling approved for the reference list-ed drug, except for changes required be-cause of differences approved under a petition filed under §314.93 or because the drug product and the reference list-ed drug are produced or distributed by different manufacturers. Such dif-ferences between the applicant’s pro-posed labeling and labeling approved for the reference listed drug may in-clude differences in expiration date, formulation, bioavailability, or phar-macokinetics, labeling revisions made to comply with current FDA labeling guidelines or other guidance, or omis-sion of an indication or other aspect of labeling protected by patent or ac-corded exclusivity under section 505(j)(5)(F) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Unless other-\\nwise stated in paragraphs (a)(9)(iii) through (a)(9)(v) of this section, an ap-plicant must identify and characterize the inactive ingredients in the pro-posed drug product and provide infor-mation demonstrating that such inac-tive ingredients do not affect the safe-ty or efficacy of the proposed drug product. \\n(iii) Inactive ingredient changes per-\\nmitted in drug products intended for par-enteral use. Generally, a drug product \\nintended for parenteral use must con-tain the same inactive ingredients and in the same concentration as the ref-erence listed drug identified by the ap-plicant under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. However, an applicant may seek approval of a drug product that differs from the reference listed drug in preservative, buffer, or antioxidant provided that the applicant identifies and characterizes the differences and provides information demonstrating that the differences do not affect the safety or efficacy of the proposed drug product. \\n(iv) Inactive ingredient changes per-\\nmitted in drug products intended for oph-thalmic or otic use.

If the ANDA \\nis for a drug or method of using a drug claimed by a patent and the applicant has a licensing agreement with the pat-ent owner, the applicant must submit a paragraph IV certification as to that patent and a statement that the appli-cant has been granted a patent license. If the patent owner consents to ap-proval of the ANDA (if otherwise eligi-ble for approval) as of a specific date, the ANDA must contain a written statement from the patent owner that it has a licensing agreement with the applicant and that it consents to ap-proval of the ANDA as of a specific date. \\n(vi) Untimely filing of patent informa-\\ntion. (A) If a patent on the listed drug \\nis issued and the holder of the approved NDA for the listed drug does not file with FDA the required information on the patent within 30 days of issuance of the patent, an applicant who submitted an ANDA for that drug that contained an appropriate patent certification or statement before the submission of the patent information is not required to submit a patent certification or state-ment to address the patent or patent information that is late-listed with re-spect to the pending ANDA. Except as provided in §314.53(f)(1), an NDA hold-er’s amendment to the description of the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent will be considered un-timely filing of patent information un-\\nless: \\n(1) The amendment to the description \\nof the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of patent issuance; \\n(2) The amendment to the description \\nof the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of approval of a cor-responding change to product labeling; or \\n(3) The amendment to the description \\nof the approved method(s) of use claimed by the patent is submitted within 30 days of a decision by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or by a Federal district court, the Court of Ap-peals for the Federal Circuit, or the U.S. Supreme Court that is specific to the patent and alters the construction of a method-of-use claim(s) of the pat-ent, and the amendment contains a copy of the decision. \\n(B) An applicant whose ANDA is sub-\\nmitted after the NDA holder’s un-timely filing of patent information, or whose pending ANDA was previously submitted but did not contain an ap-propriate patent certification or state-ment at the time of the patent submis-sion, must submit a certification under paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section and/ or a statement under paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this section as to that pat-ent. \\n(vii) Disputed patent information. If an \\napplicant disputes the accuracy or rel-evance of patent information sub-mitted to FDA, the applicant may seek a confirmation of the correctness of the patent information in accordance with the procedures under §314.53(f). Unless the patent information is with-drawn, the applicant must submit an appropriate certification or statement for each listed patent. \\n(viii) Amended certifications. A patent \\ncertification or statement submitted \\nunder paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through (iii) of this section may be amended at any time before the approval of the ANDA.

Once an amendment is submitted to change a certification, the ANDA will no longer be considered to contain the prior cer-tification. \\n(A) After finding of infringement. An \\napplicant who has submitted a para-graph IV certification and is sued for patent infringement must submit an amendment to change its certification if a court enters a final decision from which no appeal has been or can be taken, or signs and enters a settlement order or consent decree in the action that includes a finding that the patent is infringed, unless the final decision, settlement order, or consent decree also finds the patent to be invalid. In its amendment, the applicant must cer-tify under paragraph (a)(12)(i)(A)( 3) of \\nthis section that the patent will expire on a specific date or, with respect to a patent claiming a method of use, the applicant may instead provide a state-ment under paragraph (a)(12)(iii) of this section if the applicant amends its ANDA such that the applicant is no longer seeking approval for a method of use claimed by the patent. Once an amendment for the change has been submitted, the ANDA will no longer be considered to contain a paragraph IV certification to the patent. If a final judgment finds the patent to be invalid and infringed, an amended certification is not required. \\n(B) After request to remove a patent or \\npatent information from the list. If the \\nlist reflects that an NDA holder has re-quested that a patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list and no ANDA applicant is eligible for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that patent, the patent or patent information will be removed and any applicant with a pending ANDA (including a tentatively ap-proved ANDA) who has made a certifi-cation with respect to such patent must submit an amendment to with-draw its certification. In the amend-ment, the applicant must state the rea-son for withdrawing the certification or statement (that the patent has been removed from the list). If the list re-flects that an NDA holder has re-quested that a patent or patent infor-mation be removed from the list and one or more first applicants are eligi-\\nble for 180-day exclusivity based on a paragraph IV certification to that pat-ent, the patent will remain listed until any 180-day exclusivity based on that patent has expired or has been extin-\\nguished. After any applicable 180-day exclusivity has expired or has been ex-tinguished, the patent or patent infor-mation will be removed and any appli-cant with a pending ANDA (including a tentatively approved ANDA) who has made a certification with respect to such patent must submit an amend-ment to withdraw its certification. Once an amendment to withdraw the certification has been submitted, the ANDA will no longer be considered to contain a paragraph IV certification to the patent. If removal of a patent from the list results in there being no pat-ents listed for the listed drug identified in the ANDA, the applicant must sub-mit an amended certification reflecting that there are no relevant patents. \\n(C) Other amendments. (1) Except as \\nprovided in paragraphs (a)(12)(vi) and (a)(12)(viii)(C)( 2) of this section: \\n(i) An applicant must amend a sub-\\nmitted certification or statement if, at any time before the date of approval of the ANDA, the applicant learns that the submitted certification or state-ment is no longer accurate; and \\n(ii) An applicant must submit an ap-\\npropriate patent certification or state-ment under paragraph (a)(12)(i) and/or (iii) of this section if, after submission of the ANDA, a new patent is issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that, in the opinion of the applicant and to the best of its knowledge, claims the reference listed drug or that claims an approved use for such ref-erence listed drug and for which infor-mation is required to be filed under section 505(b) and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and §314.53. For a paragraph IV certifi-cation, the certification must not be submitted earlier than the first work-ing day after the day the patent is pub-lished in the list. \\n(2) An applicant is not required to \\nsubmit a supplement to change a sub-mitted certification when information on a patent on the listed drug is sub-mitted after the approval of the ANDA. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00157 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '143', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

This requirement applies to the con-tent of labeling for the proposed drug product only and is in addition to the requirements of paragraph (a)(8)(ii) of this section that copies of the for-matted label and all proposed labeling be submitted. Submissions under this paragraph must be made in accordance with part 11 of this chapter, except for the requirements of §11.10(a), (c) through (h), and (k), and the cor-responding requirements of §11.30. \\n(iii) Electronic format submissions. \\nElectronic format submissions must be in a form that FDA can process, re-view, and archive. FDA will periodi-\\ncally issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmission, media, file formats, preparation and organization of files). \\n(2) For ANDAs, the applicant must \\nsubmit a review copy of the ANDA that contains two separate sections.

(1) If, after receipt of a para-\\ngraph IV acknowledgment letter or ac-knowledgment letter, an applicant sub-mits an amendment or supplement to its ANDA that includes a paragraph IV certification, the applicant must send the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section at the same time that the amendment or supplement to the ANDA is submitted to FDA, regardless of whether the applicant has already given notice with respect to another such certification contained in the ANDA or in an amendment or supple-ment to the ANDA. \\n(2) If, before receipt of a paragraph IV \\nacknowledgment letter, an applicant submits an amendment to its ANDA that includes a paragraph IV certifi-cation, the applicant must send the no-tice required by paragraph (a) of this section in accordance with the proce-dures in paragraph (b) of this section. If an ANDA applicant’s notice of its paragraph IV certification is timely provided in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and the applicant has not submitted a previous paragraph IV certification, FDA will base its deter-mination of whether the applicant is a first applicant on the date of submis-sion of the amendment containing the paragraph IV certification. \\n(3) An applicant that submits an \\namendment or supplement to seek ap-proval of a different strength must pro-vide notice of any paragraph IV certifi-cation in accordance with paragraph \\n(d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applica-ble. \\n(e) Documentation of timely sending \\nand receipt of notice. The applicant \\nmust amend its ANDA to provide docu-mentation of the date of receipt of the notice required under paragraph (a) of this section by each person provided the notice. The amendment must be submitted to FDA within 30 days after the last date on which notice was re-ceived by a person described in para-graph (a) of this section. The appli-cant’s amendment also must include documentation that its notice was sent on a date that complies with the time-frame required by paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, as applicable, and a dated printout of the entry for the ref-erence listed drug in FDA’s ‘‘Approved \\nDrug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations’’ (the list) that includes the patent that is the subject of the paragraph IV certifi-cation. FDA will accept, as adequate documentation of the date the notice was sent, a copy of the registered mail receipt, certified mail receipt, or re-ceipt from a designated delivery serv-ice as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. FDA will accept as adequate documentation of the date of receipt a return receipt, signature proof of deliv-ery by a designated delivery service, or a letter acknowledging receipt by the person provided the notice. An appli-cant may rely on another form of docu-mentation only if FDA has agreed to such documentation in advance. A copy of the notice itself need not be sub-mitted to the Agency. \\n(f) Forty-five day period after receipt of \\nnotice. If the requirements of this sec-\\ntion are met, FDA will presume the no-tice to be complete and sufficient, and it will count the day following the date of receipt of the notice by the patent owner or its representative and by the approved NDA holder or its attorney, agent, or other authorized official as the first day of the 45-day period pro-vided for in section 505(j)(5)(B)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA may, if the applicant pro-vides a written statement to FDA that a later date should be used, count from such later date. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00160 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '146', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(1) An applicant may \\namend an ANDA that is submitted under §314.94, but not yet approved, to revise existing information or provide additional information. Amendments containing bioequivalence studies must contain reports of all bioequivalence studies conducted by the applicant on the same drug product formulation, un-less the information has previously been submitted to FDA in the ANDA. A complete study report must be sub-mitted for any bioequivalence study upon which the applicant relies for ap-proval. For all other bioequivalence studies conducted on the same drug product formulation as defined in §314.3 of this chapter, the applicant must submit either a complete or sum-mary report. If a summary report of a bioequivalence study is submitted and FDA determines that there may be bio-equivalence issues or concerns with the product, FDA may require that the ap-plicant submit a complete report of the bioequivalence study to FDA. \\n(2) Submission of an amendment con-\\ntaining significant data or information before the end of the initial review cycle constitutes an agreement be-tween FDA and the applicant to extend the initial review cycle only for the time necessary to review the signifi-cant data or information and for no \\nmore than 180 days. \\n(b) Field copy. The applicant must \\nsubmit a field copy of each amendment under §314.94(a)(9). The applicant, other than a foreign applicant, must include in its submission of each such amend-ment to FDA a statement certifying that a field copy of the amendment has been sent to the applicant’s home FDA district office. \\n(c) Different listed drug. An applicant \\nmay not amend an ANDA to seek ap-proval of a drug referring to a listed drug that is different from the ref-erence listed drug identified in the ANDA. This paragraph (c) applies if, at any time before the approval of the ANDA, a different listed drug is ap-proved that is the pharmaceutical equivalent to the product in the ANDA and is designated as a reference listed drug. This paragraph (c) also applies if changes are proposed in an amendment to the ANDA such that the proposed product is a pharmaceutical equivalent to a different listed drug than the ref-erence listed drug identified in the ANDA. A change of the reference listed drug must be submitted in a new ANDA. However, notwithstanding the limitation described in this paragraph (c), an applicant may amend the ANDA to seek approval of a different strength. \\n(d)(1) Patent certification requirements. \\nAn amendment to an ANDA is required to contain an appropriate patent cer-tification or statement described in §314.94(a)(12) or a recertification for a previously submitted paragraph IV cer-tification if approval is sought for any of the following types of amendments: \\n(i) To add a new indication or other \\ncondition of use; \\n(ii) To add a new strength; (iii) To make other than minor \\nchanges in product formulation; or \\n(iv) To change the physical form or \\ncrystalline structure of the active in-gredient. \\n(2) If the amendment to the ANDA \\ndoes not contain a patent certification or statement, the applicant must verify that the proposed change de-scribed in the amendment is not one of \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00161 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '147', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In the case of a 505(b)(2) application that contains a paragraph IV certification, the applicant will be notified via a paragraph IV acknowledgment letter. The date of filing will be the date 60 days after the date FDA received the NDA. The date of filing begins the 180- day period described in section 505(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This 180-day period is called the ‘‘filing clock.’’ \\n(3) If FDA refuses to file the NDA, \\nthe Agency will notify the applicant in writing and state the reason under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section for the refusal. If FDA refuses to file the NDA under paragraph (d) of this sec-tion, the applicant may request in writing within 30 days of the date of the Agency’s notification an informal conference with the Agency about whether the Agency should file the NDA. If, following the informal con-ference, the applicant requests that FDA file the NDA (with or without amendments to correct the defi-ciencies), the Agency will file the NDA over protest under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, notify the applicant in writing, and review it as filed. If the NDA is filed over protest, the date of filing will be the date 60 days after the date the applicant requested the infor-mal conference. The applicant need not resubmit a copy of an NDA that is filed over protest. If FDA refuses to file the NDA under paragraph (e) of this sec-tion, the applicant may amend the NDA and resubmit it, and the Agency will make a determination under this section whether it may be filed. \\n(b)(1) Receiving an ANDA. An ANDA \\nwill be evaluated after it is submitted to determine whether the ANDA may be received. Receipt of an ANDA means that FDA has made a threshold deter-mination that the abbreviated applica-tion is substantially complete. \\n(2) If FDA finds that none of the rea-\\nsons in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for considering the ANDA not to have been received applies, the ANDA is substantially complete and the Agency will receive the ANDA and notify the applicant in writing. If FDA \\ndetermines, upon evaluation, that an ANDA was substantially complete as of the date it was submitted to FDA, FDA will consider the ANDA to have been received as of the date of submission. In the case of an ANDA that contains a paragraph IV certification, the appli-cant will be notified via a paragraph IV acknowledgment letter. \\n(3) If FDA considers the ANDA not to \\nhave been received under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, FDA will notify the applicant of the refuse-to-receive decision. The applicant may then: \\n(i) Withdraw the ANDA under §314.99; \\nor \\n(ii) Correct the deficiencies and re-\\nsubmit the ANDA; or \\n(iii) Take no action, in which case \\nFDA may consider the ANDA with-drawn after 1 year. \\n(c) [Reserved] (d) NDA or ANDA deficiencies. FDA \\nmay refuse to file an NDA or may not consider an ANDA to be received if any of the following applies: \\n(1) The NDA or ANDA does not con-\\ntain a completed application form. \\n(2) The NDA or ANDA is not sub-\\nmitted in the form required under §314.50 or §314.94. \\n(3) The NDA or ANDA is incomplete \\nbecause it does not on its face contain information required under section 505(b) or section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and §314.50 or §314.94.

(1) Within \\n180 days after the date of filing, plus the period of time the review period was extended (if any), FDA will either: \\n(i) Approve the NDA; or (ii) Issue a notice of opportunity for \\na hearing if the applicant asked FDA to provide it an opportunity for a hear-ing on an NDA in response to a com-plete response letter. (2) Within 180 days after the date of \\nreceipt, plus the period of time the re-view clock was extended (if any), FDA will either approve or disapprove the ANDA. If FDA disapproves the ANDA, FDA will issue a notice of opportunity for hearing if the applicant asked FDA to provide it an opportunity for a hear-ing on an ANDA in response to a com-plete response letter. \\n(3) This paragraph (f) does not apply \\nto NDAs or ANDAs that have been withdrawn from FDA review by the ap-plicant. \\n[81 FR 69653, Oct. 6, 2016] \\n§ 314.102 Communications between \\nFDA and applicants. \\n(a) General principles. During the \\ncourse of reviewing an application or an abbreviated application, FDA shall communicate with applicants about scientific, medical, and procedural issues that arise during the review process. Such communication may take the form of telephone conversa-tions, letters, or meetings, whichever is most appropriate to discuss the par-ticular issue at hand. Communications shall be appropriately documented in the application in accordance with §10.65 of this chapter. Further details on the procedures for communication between FDA and applicants are con-tained in a staff manual guide that is publicly available. \\n(b) Notification of easily correctable de-\\nficiencies. FDA reviewers shall make \\nevery reasonable effort to commu-nicate promptly to applicants easily correctable deficiencies found in an ap-plication or an abbreviated application when those deficiencies are discovered, particularly deficiencies concerning chemistry, manufacturing, and con-trols issues. The agency will also in-form applicants promptly of its need for more data or information or for technical changes in the application or the abbreviated application needed to facilitate the agency’s review. This early communication is intended to permit applicants to correct such read-ily identified deficiencies relatively early in the review process and to sub-mit an amendment before the review period has elapsed.

Instead, major scientific issues will ordinarily be addressed in a com-plete response letter. \\n(c) Ninety-day conference. Approxi-\\nmately 90 days after the agency re-ceives the application, FDA will pro-vide applicants with an opportunity to meet with agency reviewing officials. The purpose of the meeting will be to inform applicants of the general progress and status of their applica-tions, and to advise applicants of defi-ciencies that have been identified by that time and that have not already been communicated. This meeting will be available on applications for all new chemical entities and major new indi-cations of marketed drugs. Such meet-ings will be held at the applicant’s op-tion, and may be held by telephone if mutually agreed upon. Such meetings would not ordinarily be held on abbre-viated applications because they are not submitted for new chemical enti-ties or new indications. \\n(d) End-of-review conference. At the \\nconclusion of FDA’s review of an NDA as designated by the issuance of a com-plete response letter, FDA will provide the applicant with an opportunity to meet with agency reviewing officials. The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss what further steps need to be taken by the applicant before the ap-plication can be approved. Requests for such meetings must be directed to the director of the division responsible for reviewing the application. \\n(e) Other meetings. Other meetings be-\\ntween FDA and applicants may be held, with advance notice, to discuss sci-entific, medical, and other issues that arise during the review process. Re-quests for meetings shall be directed to the director of the division responsible for reviewing the application or abbre-viated application. FDA will make every attempt to grant requests for meetings that involve important issues and that can be scheduled at mutually convenient times. However, ‘‘drop-in’’ \\nvisits ( i.e., an unannounced and un-\\nscheduled visit by a company rep-resentative) are discouraged except for urgent matters, such as to discuss an \\nimportant new safety issue. \\n[57 FR 17988, Apr. 28, 1992; 57 FR 29353, July \\n1, 1992, as amended at 73 FR 39609, July 10, 2008] \\n§ 314.103 Dispute resolution. \\n(a) General. FDA is committed to re-\\nsolving differences between applicants and FDA reviewing divisions with re-spect to technical requirements for ap-plications or abbreviated applications as quickly and amicably as possible through the cooperative exchange of information and views. \\n(b) Administrative and procedural \\nissues. When administrative or proce-\\ndural disputes arise, the applicant should first attempt to resolve the matter with the division responsible for reviewing the application or abbre-viated application, beginning with the consumer safety officer assigned to the application or abbreviated application. If resolution is not achieved, the appli-cant may raise the matter with the person designated as ombudsman, whose function shall be to investigate what has happened and to facilitate a timely and equitable resolution. Appro-priate issues to raise with the ombuds-man include resolving difficulties in scheduling meetings, obtaining timely replies to inquiries, and obtaining timely completion of pending reviews. Further details on this procedure are contained in a staff manual guide that is publicly available under FDA’s pub-lic information regulations in part 20. \\n(c) Scientific and medical disputes. (1) \\nBecause major scientific issues are or-dinarily communicated to applicants in a complete response letter pursuant to §314.110, the ‘‘end-of-review con-ference’’ described in §314.102(d) will provide a timely forum for discussing and resolving, if possible, scientific and medical issues on which the applicant disagrees with the agency. In addition, the ‘‘ninety-day conference’’ described in §314.102(c) will provide a timely forum for discussing and resolving, if possible, issues identified by that date. \\n(2) When scientific or medical dis-\\nputes arise at other times during the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00165 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '151', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Ordi-narily, such meetings would be held first with the Division Director, then with the Office Director, and finally with the Center Director if the matter is still unresolved. Requests for such meetings shall be directed to the direc-tor of the division responsible for re-viewing the application or abrreviated application. FDA will make every at-tempt to grant requests for meetings that involve important issues and that can be scheduled at mutually conven-ient times. \\n(3) In requesting a meeting designed \\nto resolve a scientific or medical dis-pute, applicants may suggest that FDA seek the advice of outside experts, in which case FDA may, in its discretion, invite to the meeting one or more of its advisory committee members or other consultants, as designated by the agen-cy. Applicants may also bring their own consultants. For major scientific and medical policy issues not resolved by informal meetings, FDA may refer the matter to one of its standing advi-sory committees for its consideration and recommendations. \\n[50 FR 7493, Feb. 22, 1985; 50 FR 14212, Apr. 11, \\n1985, as amended at 57 FR 17989, Apr. 28, 1992; 73 FR 39609, July 10, 2008] \\n§ 314.104 Drugs with potential for \\nabuse. \\nThe Food and Drug Administration \\nwill inform the Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration under section 201(f) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801) when an application or abbreviated application is submitted for a drug that appears to have an abuse poten-tial. \\n[57 FR 17989, Apr. 28, 1992] \\n§ 314.105 Approval of an NDA and an \\nANDA. \\n(a) FDA will approve an NDA and \\nsend the applicant an approval letter if none of the reasons in §314.125 for re-\\nfusing to approve the NDA applies. FDA will issue a tentative approval letter if an NDA otherwise meets the requirements for approval under the \\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but cannot be approved because there is a 7-year period of orphan exclusivity for the listed drug under section 527 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and §316.31 of this chapter, or if a 505(b)(2) application otherwise meets the requirements for approval under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but cannot be approved until the conditions in §314.107(b)(3) are met; be-cause there is a period of exclusivity for the listed drug under §314.108; be-cause there is a period of pediatric ex-clusivity for the listed drug under sec-tion 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or because there is a period of exclusivity for the listed drug under section 505E of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A drug prod-uct that is granted tentative approval is not an approved drug and will not be approved until FDA issues an approval after any necessary additional review of the NDA. FDA’s tentative approval of a drug product is based on informa-tion available to FDA at the time of the tentative approval letter ( i.e., in-\\nformation in the 505(b)(2) application and the status of current good manu-facturing practices of the facilities used in the manufacturing and testing of the drug product) and is therefore subject to change on the basis of new information that may come to FDA’s attention. A new drug product may not be marketed until the date of approval. \\n(b) FDA will approve an NDA and \\nissue the applicant an approval letter on the basis of draft labeling if the only deficiencies in the NDA concern editorial or similar minor deficiencies in the draft labeling. Such approval will be conditioned upon the applicant incorporating the specified labeling changes exactly as directed, and upon the applicant submitting to FDA a copy of the final printed labeling prior to marketing. \\n(c) FDA will approve an NDA after it \\ndetermines that the drug meets the statutory standards for safety and ef-fectiveness, manufacturing and con-trols, and labeling, and an ANDA after it determines that the drug meets the statutory standards for manufacturing and controls, labeling, and, where ap-plicable, bioequivalence.

The acceptance of foreign \\ndata in an application generally is gov-erned by §312.120 of this chapter. \\n(b) As sole basis for marketing approval. \\nAn application based solely on foreign clinical data meeting U.S. criteria for marketing approval may be approved if: (1) The foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. med-ical practice; (2) the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an in-spection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria will result in the ap-plication not being approvable based on the foreign data alone. FDA will apply this policy in a flexible manner accord-ing to the nature of the drug and the data being considered. \\n(c) Consultation between FDA and ap-\\nplicants.

FDA will issue \\na tentative approval letter when ten-tative approval is appropriate in ac-cordance with this section. In order for a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA to be approved under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the applicant must receive an approval letter from the Agency. Ten-tative approval of an NDA or ANDA does not constitute ‘‘approval’’ of an NDA or ANDA and cannot, absent an approval letter from the Agency, result in an approval under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. \\n(c) Timing of approval of subsequent \\nANDA.

The ANDA of a subsequent applicant will not be approved during the period when any first applicant is eligible for 180-day exclusivity or during the 180- day exclusivity period of a first appli-cant. Any applicable 180-day exclu-sivity period cannot extend beyond the expiration of the patent upon which the 180-day exclusivity period was based. \\n(2) A first applicant must submit cor-\\nrespondence to its ANDA notifying FDA within 30 days of the date of its first commercial marketing of its drug product or the reference listed drug. If an applicant does not notify FDA, as required in this paragraph (c)(2), of this date, the date of first commercial mar-keting will be deemed to be the date of the drug product’s approval. \\n(3) If FDA concludes that a first ap-\\nplicant is not actively pursuing ap-proval of its ANDA, FDA may imme-diately approve an ANDA(s) of a subse-quent applicant(s) if the ANDA(s) is otherwise eligible for approval. \\n(d) Delay due to exclusivity.

I (4–1–21 Edition) § 314.108 \\nApproved under section 505(b) means \\nan NDA submitted under section 505(b) and approved on or after October 10, 1962, or an application that was ‘‘deemed approved’’ under section 107(c)(2) of Public Law 87–781. \\nBioavailability study means a study to \\ndetermine the bioavailability or the pharmacokinetics of a drug. \\nClinical investigation means any ex-\\nperiment other than a bioavailability study in which a drug is administered or dispensed to, or used on, human sub-jects. \\nConducted or sponsored by the appli-\\ncant with regard to an investigation \\nmeans that before or during the inves-tigation, the applicant was named in Form FDA–1571 filed with FDA as the sponsor of the investigational new drug application under which the investiga-tion was conducted, or the applicant or the applicant’s predecessor in interest, provided substantial support for the in-vestigation. To demonstrate ‘‘substan-tial support,’’ an applicant must either provide a certified statement from a certified public accountant that the ap-plicant provided 50 percent or more of the cost of conducting the study or provide an explanation why FDA should consider the applicant to have conducted or sponsored the study if the applicant’s financial contribution to the study is less than 50 percent or the applicant did not sponsor the inves-tigational new drug. A predecessor in interest is an entity, e.g., a corpora-tion, that the applicant has taken over, merged with, or purchased, or from which the applicant has purchased all rights to the drug. Purchase of non-exclusive rights to a clinical investiga-tion after it is completed is not suffi-cient to satisfy this definition. \\nEssential to approval means, with re-\\ngard to an investigation, that there are no other data available that could sup-port approval of the NDA. \\nNew chemical entity means a drug that \\ncontains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\nNew clinical investigation means an in-\\nvestigation in humans the results of which have not been relied on by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved \\ndrug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied on by the agency to demonstrate the effective-ness or safety in a new patient popu-lation of a previously approved drug product. For purposes of this section, data from a clinical investigation pre-viously submitted for use in the com-prehensive evaluation of the safety of a drug product but not to support the ef-fectiveness of the drug product would be considered new. \\n(b) Submission of and timing of ap-\\nproval of a 505(b)(2) application or ANDA. (1) [Reserved] \\n(2) If a drug product that contains a \\nnew chemical entity was approved after September 24, 1984, in an NDA submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, no person may submit a 505(b)(2) appli-cation or ANDA under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for a drug product that contains the same active moiety as in the new chemical entity for a period of 5 years from the date of approval of the first approved NDA, except that the 505(b)(2) application or ANDA may be submitted after 4 years if it contains a certifi-cation of patent invalidity or non-infringement described in §314.50(i)(1)(i)(A)( 4) or \\n§314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)( 4). \\n(3) The approval of a 505(b)(2) applica-\\ntion or ANDA described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will occur as pro-vided in §314.107(b)(1) or (2), unless the owner of a patent that claims the drug, the patent owner’s representative, or exclusive licensee brings suit for pat-ent infringement against the applicant during the 1-year period beginning 48 months after the date of approval of the NDA for the new chemical entity and within 45 days after receipt of the notice described at §314.52 or §314.95, in which case, approval of the 505(b)(2) ap-plication or ANDA will occur as pro-vided in §314.107(b)(3). \\n(4) If an NDA: (i) Was submitted under section \\n505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; \\n(ii) Was approved after September 24, \\n1984; \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00172 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '158', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

FDA will \\nsend the applicant a complete response letter if the agency determines that we will not approve the application or ab-breviated application in its present form for one or more of the reasons given in §314.125 or §314.127, respec-tively. \\n(1) Description of specific deficiencies. A \\ncomplete response letter will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application or abbreviated application, except as stated in paragraph (a)(3) of this sec-\\ntion. \\n(2) Complete review of data. A com-\\nplete response letter reflects FDA’s complete review of the data submitted in an original application or abbre-viated application (or, where appro-priate, a resubmission) and any amend-ments that the agency has reviewed. The complete response letter will iden-tify any amendments that the agency has not yet reviewed. \\n(3) Inadequate data. If FDA deter-\\nmines, after an application is filed or an abbreviated application is received, that the data submitted are inadequate to support approval, the agency might issue a complete response letter with-out first conducting required inspec-tions and/or reviewing proposed prod-uct labeling. \\n(4) Recommendation of actions for ap-\\nproval. When possible, a complete re-\\nsponse letter will recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the application or abbreviated applica-tion in condition for approval. \\n(b) Applicant actions. After receiving \\na complete response letter, the appli-cant must take one of following ac-tions: \\n(1) Resubmission. Resubmit the appli-\\ncation or abbreviated application, ad-dressing all deficiencies identified in the complete response letter. \\n(i) A resubmission of an application \\nor efficacy supplement that FDA clas-sifies as a Class 1 resubmission con-stitutes an agreement by the applicant to start a new 2-month review cycle be-ginning on the date FDA receives the resubmission. \\n(ii) A resubmission of an application \\nor efficacy supplement that FDA clas-sifies as a Class 2 resubmission con-stitutes an agreement by the applicant to start a new 6-month review cycle be-ginning on the date FDA receives the resubmission. \\n(iii) A resubmission of an NDA sup-\\nplement other than an efficacy supple-ment constitutes an agreement by the applicant to start a new review cycle the same length as the initial review cycle for the supplement (excluding any extension due to a major amend-ment of the initial supplement), begin-ning on the date FDA receives the re-submission. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00173 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '159', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

I (4–1–21 Edition) § 314.120 \\n(iv) A major resubmission of an ab-\\nbreviated application constitutes an agreement by the applicant to start a new 6-month review cycle beginning on the date FDA receives the resubmis-sion. \\n(v) A minor resubmission of an abbre-\\nviated application constitutes an agreement by the applicant to start a new review cycle beginning on the date FDA receives the resubmission. \\n(2) Withdrawal. Withdraw the applica-\\ntion or abbreviated application. A deci-sion to withdraw an application or ab-breviated application is without preju-dice to a subsequent submission. \\n(3) Request opportunity for hearing. \\nAsk the agency to provide the appli-cant an opportunity for a hearing on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval of the ap-plication or abbreviated application under section 505(d) or (j)(4) of the act, respectively. The applicant must sub-mit the request to the Associate Direc-tor for Policy, Center for Drug Evalua-tion and Research, Food and Drug Ad-ministration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993. Within 60 days of the date of the request for an opportunity for a hearing, or within a different time period to which FDA and the applicant agree, the agency will ei-ther approve the application or abbre-viated application under §314.105, or refuse to approve the application under §314.125 or abbreviated application under §314.127 and give the applicant written notice of an opportunity for a hearing under §314.200 and section 505(c)(1)(B) or (j)(5)(c) of the act on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval of the application or abbreviated application under sec-tion 505(d) or (j)(4) of the act, respec-tively. \\n(c) Failure to take action. (1) An appli-\\ncant agrees to extend the review period under section 505(c)(1) or (j)(5)(A) of the act until it takes any of the actions listed in paragraph (b) of this section. For an application or abbreviated ap-plication, FDA may consider an appli-cant’s failure to take any of such ac-tions within 1 year after issuance of a complete response letter to be a re-quest by the applicant to withdraw the application, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit the application. \\nFDA will grant any reasonable request for such an extension. FDA may con-sider an applicant’s failure to resubmit the application within the extended time period or to request an additional extension to be a request by the appli-cant to withdraw the application. \\n(2) If FDA considers an applicant’s \\nfailure to take action in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to be a request to withdraw the applica-tion, the agency will notify the appli-cant in writing. The applicant will have 30 days from the date of the noti-fication to explain why the application should not be withdrawn and to request an extension of time in which to resub-mit the application. FDA will grant any reasonable request for an exten-sion. If the applicant does not respond to the notification within 30 days, the application will be deemed to be with-drawn. \\n[73 FR 39609, July 10, 2008] \\n§ 314.120 [Reserved] \\n§ 314.122 Submitting an abbreviated \\napplication for, or a 505(j)(2)(C) pe-tition that relies on, a listed drug that is no longer marketed. \\n(a) An abbreviated new drug applica-\\ntion that refers to, or a petition under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act and §314.93 that relies on, a listed drug that has been voluntarily withdrawn from sale in the United States must be ac-companied by a petition seeking a de-termination whether the listed drug was withdrawn for safety or effective-ness reasons.

The charac-teristics described in paragraph (b) of this section have been developed over a period of years and are recognized by the scientific community as the essen-tials of an adequate and well-con-trolled clinical investigation. The Food and Drug Administration considers these characteristics in determining whether an investigation is adequate and well-controlled for purposes of sec-tion 505 of the act. Reports of adequate and well-controlled investigations pro-vide the primary basis for determining whether there is ‘‘substantial evi-dence’’ to support the claims of effec-tiveness for new drugs. Therefore, the study report should provide sufficient details of study design, conduct, and analysis to allow critical evaluation and a determination of whether the characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study are present. \\n(b) An adequate and well-controlled \\nstudy has the following characteristics: \\n(1) There is a clear statement of the \\nobjectives of the investigation and a summary of the proposed or actual \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00176 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '162', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In addition, the protocol should contain a description of the proposed methods of analysis, and the study re-port should contain a description of the methods of analysis ultimately used. If the protocol does not contain a descrip-tion of the proposed methods of anal-ysis, the study report should describe how the methods used were selected. \\n(2) The study uses a design that per-\\nmits a valid comparison with a control to provide a quantitative assessment of drug effect. The protocol for the study and report of results should describe the study design precisely; for example, duration of treatment periods, whether treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and whether the sample size is predetermined or based upon some interim analysis. Generally, the fol-lowing types of control are recognized: \\n(i) Placebo concurrent control. The test \\ndrug is compared with an inactive preparation designed to resemble the test drug as far as possible. A placebo- controlled study may include addi-tional treatment groups, such as an ac-tive treatment control or a dose-com-parison control, and usually includes randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both. \\n(ii) Dose-comparison concurrent con-\\ntrol. At least two doses of the drug are \\ncompared. A dose-comparison study may include additional treatment groups, such as placebo control or ac-tive control. Dose-comparison trials usually include randomization and blinding of patients or investigators, or both. \\n(iii) No treatment concurrent control. \\nWhere objective measurements of effec-tiveness are available and placebo ef-fect is negligible, the test drug is com-pared with no treatment. No treatment concurrent control trials usually in-clude randomization. \\n(iv) Active treatment concurrent con-\\ntrol. The test drug is compared with \\nknown effective therapy; for example, where the condition treated is such that administration of placebo or no treatment would be contrary to the in-terest of the patient. An active treat-ment study may include additional treatment groups, however, such as a placebo control or a dose-comparison control. Active treatment trials usu-\\nally include randomization and blind-ing of patients or investigators, or both. If the intent of the trial is to show similarity of the test and control drugs, the report of the study should assess the ability of the study to have detected a difference between treat-ments. Similarity of test drug and ac-tive control can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. The analysis of the study should explain why the drugs should be considered effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in pre-vious placebo-controlled studies of the active control drug. \\n(v) Historical control. The results of \\ntreatment with the test drug are com-pared with experience historically de-rived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or condi-tion, or from the results of active treatment, in comparable patients or populations. Because historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with respect to pertinent vari-ables as can concurrent control popu-lations, historical control designs are usually reserved for special cir-cumstances. Examples include studies of diseases with high and predictable mortality (for example, certain malig-nancies) and studies in which the effect of the drug is self-evident (general an-esthetics, drug metabolism). \\n(3) The method of selection of sub-\\njects provides adequate assurance that they have the disease or condition being studied, or evidence of suscepti-bility and exposure to the condition against which prophylaxis is directed. \\n(4) The method of assigning patients \\nto treatment and control groups mini-mizes bias and is intended to assure comparability of the groups with re-spect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, severity of disease, duration of disease, and use of drugs or therapy other than the test drug. The protocol for the study and the report of its re-sults should describe how subjects were assigned to groups. Ordinarily, in a concurrently controlled study, assign-ment is by randomization, with or without stratification. \\n(5) Adequate measures are taken to \\nminimize bias on the part of the sub-jects, observers, and analysts of the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00177 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '163', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The protocol and report of the \\nstudy should describe the procedures used to accomplish this, such as blind-ing. \\n(6) The methods of assessment of sub-\\njects’ response are well-defined and re-liable. The protocol for the study and the report of results should explain the variables measured, the methods of ob-servation, and criteria used to assess response. \\n(7) There is an analysis of the results \\nof the study adequate to assess the ef-fects of the drug. The report of the study should describe the results and the analytic methods used to evaluate them, including any appropriate statis-tical methods. The analysis should as-sess, among other things, the com-parability of test and control groups with respect to pertinent variables, and the effects of any interim data anal-yses performed. \\n(c) The Director of the Center for \\nDrug Evaluation and Research may, on the Director’s own initiative or on the petition of an interested person, waive in whole or in part any of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section with re-spect to a specific clinical investiga-tion, either prior to the investigation or in the evaluation of a completed study. A petition for a waiver is re-quired to set forth clearly and con-cisely the specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the criteria are not reasonably applicable to the par-ticular clinical investigation, what al-ternative procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and what re-sults have been obtained.

      "page_content='179 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 314.200 \\n(e) Contentions that a drug product is \\nnot subject to the new drug requirements. A notice of opportunity for a hearing encompasses all issues relating to the legal status of each drug product sub-ject to it, including identical, related, and similar drug products as defined in §310.6. A notice of appearance and re-quest for a hearing under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section is required to contain any contention that the prod-uct is not a new drug because it is gen-erally recognized as safe and effective within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act, or because it is exempt from part or all of the new drug provisions of the act under the exemption for products marketed before June 25, 1938, contained in section 201(p) of the act or under section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962, or for any other reason. Each contention is required to be supported by a submission under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will make an administrative deter-mination on each contention. The fail-ure of any person subject to a notice of opportunity for a hearing, including any person who manufactures or dis-tributes an identical, related, or simi-lar drug product as defined in §310.6, to submit a notice of participation and re-quest for hearing or to raise all such contentions constitutes a waiver of any contentions not raised. \\n(1) A contention that a drug product \\nis generally recognized as safe and ef-fective within the meaning of section 201(p) of the act is required to be sup-ported by submission of the same quan-tity and quality of scientific evidence that is required to obtain approval of an application for the product, unless FDA has waived a requirement for ef-fectiveness (under §314.126) or safety, or both. The submission should be in the format and with the analyses re-quired under paragraph (d) of this sec-tion. A person who fails to submit the required scientific evidence required under paragraph (d) waives the conten-tion. General recognition of safety and effectiveness shall ordinarily be based upon published studies which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. \\n(2) A contention that a drug product \\nis exempt from part or all of the new drug provisions of the act under the ex-\\nemption for products marketed before June 25, 1938, contained in section 201(p) of the act, or under section 107(c) of the Drug Amendments of 1962, is re-quired to be supported by evidence of past and present quantitative for-mulas, labeling, and evidence of mar-keting. A person who makes such a contention should submit the formulas, labeling, and evidence of marketing in the following format. \\nI. Formulation. \\nA. A copy of each pertinent document or \\nrecord to establish the exact quantitative formulation of the drug (both active and in-active ingredients) on the date of initial marketing of the drug. \\nB. A statement whether such formulation \\nhas at any subsequent time been changed in any manner. If any such change has been made, the exact date, nature, and rationale for each change in formulation, including any deletion or change in the concentration of any active ingredient and/or inactive in-gredient, should be stated, together with a copy of each pertinent document or record to establish the date and nature of each such change, including, but not limited to, the formula which resulted from each such change. If no such change has been made, a copy of representative documents or records showing the formula at representative points in time should be submitted to support the statement. \\nII. Labeling. A. A copy of each pertinent document or \\nrecord to establish the identity of each item of written, printed, or graphic matter used as labeling on the date the drug was initially marketed. \\nB.

If such discontinu-ance or change has been made, the exact date, nature, and rationale for each dis-continuance or change and a copy of each \\npertinent document or record to establish each such discontinuance or change should be submitted, including, but not limited to, the labeling which resulted from each such discontinuance or change. If no such dis-continuance or change has been made, a copy of representative documents or records show-ing labeling at representative points in time should be submitted to support the state-ment. \\nIII.

Separation \\nof functions commences upon receipt of a request for hearing. The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search, Food and Drug Administration, will prepare an analysis of the request and a proposed order ruling on the matter. The analysis and proposed order, the request for hearing, and any proposed order denying a hearing and response under paragraph (g) (2) or (3) of this section will be submitted to the Office of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for review and decision. When the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search recommends denial of a hearing on all issues on which a hearing is re-quested, no representative of the Cen-ter will participate or advise in the re-view and decision by the Commis-sioner. When the Center for Drug Eval-\\nuation and Research recommends that a hearing be granted on one or more issues on which a hearing is requested, separation of functions terminates as to those issues, and representatives of the Center may participate or advise in the review and decision by the Com-missioner on those issues. The Com-missioner may modify the text of the issues, but may not deny a hearing on those issues. Separation of functions continues with respect to issues on which the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has recommended denial of a hearing. The Commissioner will neither evaluate nor rule on the Cen-ter’s recommendation on such issues and such issues will not be included in the notice of hearing. Participants in the hearing may make a motion to the presiding officer for the inclusion of any such issue in the hearing. The rul-ing on such a motion is subject to re-view in accordance with §12.35(b). Fail-ure to so move constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on such an issue. Separation of functions on all issues resumes upon issuance of a notice of hearing. The Office of the General Counsel, Department of Health and Human Services, will observe the same separation of functions. \\n(g) Summary judgment. A person who \\nrequests a hearing may not rely upon allegations or denials but is required to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing with re-spect to a particular drug product spec-ified in the request for hearing. \\n(1) Where a specific notice of oppor-\\ntunity for hearing (as defined in para-graph (a)(1) of this section) is used, the Commissioner will enter summary judgment against a person who re-quests a hearing, making findings and conclusions, denying a hearing, if it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information, and factual analyses in the request for the hearing that there is no genuine and substan-tial issue of fact which precludes the refusal to approve the application or abbreviated application or the with-drawal of approval of the application or abbreviated application; for example, no adequate and well-controlled clin-ical investigations meeting each of the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00190 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '176', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Subpart I—Approval of New Drugs \\nWhen Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible \\nSOURCE : 67 FR 37995, May 31, 2002, unless \\notherwise noted. \\n§ 314.600 Scope. \\nThis subpart applies to certain new \\ndrug products that have been studied for their safety and efficacy in amelio-rating or preventing serious or life- threatening conditions caused by expo-sure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic biological, chemical, radio-logical, or nuclear substances. This subpart applies only to those new drug products for which: Definitive human efficacy studies cannot be conducted because it would be unethical to delib-erately expose healthy human volun-teers to a lethal or permanently dis-abling toxic biological, chemical, radi-ological, or nuclear substance; and field trials to study the product’s effec-tiveness after an accidental or hostile exposure have not been feasible. This subpart does not apply to products that can be approved based on efficacy standards described elsewhere in FDA’s regulations (e.g., accelerated approval based on surrogate markers or clinical endpoints other than survival or irre-versible morbidity), nor does it address the safety evaluation for the products to which it does apply. \\n§ 314.610 Approval based on evidence \\nof effectiveness from studies in ani-mals. \\n(a) FDA may grant marketing ap-\\nproval for a new drug product for which safety has been established and for which the requirements of §314.600 are met based on adequate and well-con-trolled animal studies when the results of those animal studies establish that \\nthe drug product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans. In assessing the sufficiency of animal data, the agency may take into ac-count other data, including human data, available to the agency. FDA will rely on the evidence from studies in animals to provide substantial evi-dence of the effectiveness of these products only when: \\n(1) There is a reasonably well-under-\\nstood pathophysiological mechanism of \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00198 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '184', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The appli-\\ncant must conduct postmarketing studies, such as field studies, to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit and to assess its safety when used as indicated when such studies are fea-sible and ethical. Such postmarketing studies would not be feasible until an exigency arises. When such studies are feasible, the applicant must conduct such studies with due diligence. Appli-cants must include as part of their ap-plication a plan or approach to post-marketing study commitments in the event such studies become ethical and feasible. \\n(2) Approval with restrictions to ensure \\nsafe use. If FDA concludes that a drug \\nproduct shown to be effective under this subpart can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, FDA will require such postmarketing re-strictions as are needed to ensure safe use of the drug product, commensurate with the specific safety concerns pre-sented by the drug product, such as: \\n(i) Distribution restricted to certain \\nfacilities or health care practitioners with special training or experience; \\n(ii) Distribution conditioned on the \\nperformance of specified medical proce-dures, including medical followup; and \\n(iii) Distribution conditioned on \\nspecified recordkeeping requirements. (3) Information to be provided to patient \\nrecipients. For drug products or specific \\nindications approved under this sub-part, applicants must prepare, as part of their proposed labeling, labeling to be provided to patient recipients. The patient labeling must explain that, for \\nethical or feasibility reasons, the drug’s approval was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals alone and must give the drug’s indication(s), di-rections for use (dosage and adminis-tration), contraindications, a descrip-tion of any reasonably foreseeable risks, adverse reactions, anticipated benefits, drug interactions, and any other relevant information required by FDA at the time of approval. The pa-tient labeling must be available with the product to be provided to patients prior to administration or dispensing of the drug product for the use ap-proved under this subpart, if possible. \\n§ 314.620 Withdrawal procedures. \\n(a) Reasons to withdraw approval. For \\nnew drugs approved under this subpart, FDA may withdraw approval, following a hearing as provided in part 15 of this chapter, as modified by this section, if: \\n(1) A postmarketing clinical study \\nfails to verify clinical benefit; \\n(2) The applicant fails to perform the \\npostmarketing study with due dili-gence; \\n(3) Use after marketing demonstrates \\nthat postmarketing restrictions are in-adequate to ensure safe use of the drug product; \\n(4) The applicant fails to adhere to \\nthe postmarketing restrictions applied at the time of approval under this sub-part; \\n(5) The promotional materials are \\nfalse or misleading; or \\n(6) Other evidence demonstrates that \\nthe drug product is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use. \\n(b) Notice of opportunity for a hearing. \\nThe Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) will give the applicant notice of an oppor-tunity for a hearing on CDER’s pro-posal to withdraw the approval of an application approved under this sub-part.

They do not apply to radiopharmaceuticals intended for therapeutic purposes. In situations where a particular radiopharma-ceutical is proposed for both diagnostic and therapeutic uses, the radiopharma-ceutical must be evaluated taking into account each intended use. \\n§ 315.2 Definition. \\nFor purposes of this part, diagnostic \\nradiopharmaceutical means: \\n(a) An article that is intended for use \\nin the diagnosis or monitoring of a dis-ease or a manifestation of a disease in humans and that exhibits spontaneous disintegration of unstable nuclei with the emission of nuclear particles or photons; or \\n(b) Any nonradioactive reagent kit or \\nnuclide generator that is intended to be used in the preparation of such arti-cle as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. \\n§ 315.3 General factors relevant to \\nsafety and effectiveness. \\nFDA’s determination of the safety \\nand effectiveness of a diagnostic radio-pharmaceutical includes consideration of the following: \\n(a) The proposed use of the diagnostic \\nradiopharmaceutical in the practice of medicine, \\n(b) The pharmacological and toxi-\\ncological activity of the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical (including any carrier or ligand component of the di-agnostic radiopharmaceutical), and \\n(c) The estimated absorbed radiation \\ndose of the diagnostic radiopharma-ceutical. § 315.4 Indications. \\n(a) For diagnostic radiopharma-\\nceuticals, the categories of proposed indications for use include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n(1) Structure delineation; (2) Functional, physiological, or bio-\\nchemical assessment; \\n(3) Disease or pathology detection or \\nassessment; and \\n(4) Diagnostic or therapeutic patient \\nmanagement. \\n(b) Where a diagnostic radiopharma-\\nceutical is not intended to provide dis-ease-specific information, the proposed indications for use may refer to a bio-chemical, physiological, anatomical, or pathological process or to more than one disease or condition. \\n§ 315.5 Evaluation of effectiveness. \\n(a) The effectiveness of a diagnostic \\nradiopharmaceutical is assessed by evaluating its ability to provide useful clinical information related to its pro-posed indications for use. The method of this evaluation varies depending upon the proposed indication(s) and may use one or more of the following criteria: \\n(1) The claim of structure delineation \\nis established by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting the ability to locate anatomical structures and to characterize their anatomy. \\n(2) The claim of functional, physio-\\nlogical, or biochemical assessment is established by demonstrating in a de-\\nfined clinical setting reliable measure-ment of function(s) or physiological, biochemical, or molecular process(es). \\n(3) The claim of disease or pathology \\ndetection or assessment is established by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting that the diagnostic radio-pharmaceutical has sufficient accuracy in identifying or characterizing the dis-ease or pathology. \\n(4) The claim of diagnostic or thera-\\npeutic patient management is estab-lished by demonstrating in a defined clinical setting that the test is useful in diagnostic or therapeutic patient management. \\n(5) For a claim that does not fall \\nwithin the indication categories identi-fied in §315.4, the applicant or sponsor \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00201 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '187', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

A reliable assessment of actual clinical status may be provided by a diagnostic standard or standards of demonstrated accuracy. In the absence of such diag-nostic standard(s), the actual clinical status must be established in another manner, e.g., patient followup. \\n§ 315.6 Evaluation of safety. \\n(a) Factors considered in the safety \\nassessment of a diagnostic radio-pharmaceutical include, among others, the following: \\n(1) The radiation dose; (2) The pharmacology and toxicology \\nof the radiopharmaceutical, including any radionuclide, carrier, or ligand; \\n(3) The risks of an incorrect diag-\\nnostic determination; \\n(4) The adverse reaction profile of the \\ndrug; \\n(5) Results of human experience with \\nthe radiopharmaceutical for other uses; and \\n(6) Results of any previous human ex-\\nperience with the carrier or ligand of the radiopharmaceutical when the same chemical entity as the carrier or ligand has been used in a previously studied product. \\n(b) The assessment of the adverse re-\\naction profile includes, but is not lim-ited to, an evaluation of the potential of the diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, including the carrier or ligand, to elic-it the following: \\n(1) Allergic or hypersensitivity re-\\nsponses, \\n(2) Immunologic responses, (3) Changes in the physiologic or bio-\\nchemical function of the target and nontarget tissues, and \\n(4) Clinically detectable signs or \\nsymptoms. \\n(c)(1) To establish the safety of a di-\\nagnostic radiopharmaceutical, FDA may require, among other information, the following types of data: \\n(i) Pharmacology data, (ii) Toxicology data, (iii) Clinical adverse event data, and (iv) Radiation safety assessment. (2) The amount of new safety data re-\\nquired will depend on the characteris-tics of the product and available infor-mation regarding the safety of the di-agnostic radiopharmaceutical, and its carrier or ligand, obtained from other studies and uses. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the dose, route of administration, fre-quency of use, half-life of the ligand or carrier, half-life of the radionuclide, and results of clinical and preclinical studies. FDA will establish categories of diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals based on defined characteristics rel-evant to risk and will specify the amount and type of safety data that are appropriate for each category (e.g., required safety data may be limited for diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals with a well established, low-risk profile). Upon reviewing the relevant product characteristics and safety information, FDA will place each diagnostic radio-pharmaceutical into the appropriate safety risk category. \\n(d) Radiation safety assessment. The \\nradiation safety assessment must es-tablish the radiation dose of a diag-nostic radiopharmaceutical by radi-ation dosimetry evaluations in humans and appropriate animal models. The maximum tolerated dose need not be established. \\nPART 316—ORPHAN DRUGS \\nSubpart A—General Provisions \\nSec. \\n316.1 Scope of this part. 316.2 Purpose. 316.3 Definitions. 316.4 Address for submissions. \\nSubpart B—Written Recommendations for \\nInvestigations of Orphan Drugs \\n316.10 Content and format of a request for \\nwritten recommendations. \\n316.12 Providing written recommendations. 316.14 Refusal to provide written rec-\\nommendations. \\nSubpart C—Designation of an Orphan \\nDrug \\n316.20 Content and format of a request for \\norphan-drug designation. \\n316.21 Verification of orphan-drug status. 316.22 Permanent-resident agent for foreign \\nsponsor. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00202 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '188', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Generally, this would represent the same kind of evidence needed to support a comparative effectiveness claim for two different drugs; in most cases, direct comparative clinical trials would be necessary; or \\n(ii) Greater safety in a substantial \\nportion of the target populations, for example, by the elimination of an in-gredient or contaminant that is associ-ated with relatively frequent adverse effects. In some cases, direct compara-tive clinical trials will be necessary; or \\n(iii) In unusual cases, where neither \\ngreater safety nor greater effectiveness has been shown, a demonstration that the drug otherwise makes a major con-tribution to patient care. \\n(4) Director means the Director of \\nFDA’s Office of Orphan Products Devel-opment. \\n(5) FDA means the Food and Drug \\nAdministration. \\n(6) Holder means the sponsor in whose \\nname an orphan drug is designated and approved. \\n(7) IND means an investigational new \\ndrug application under part 312 of this chapter. \\n(8) Manufacturer means any person or \\nagency engaged in the manufacture of a drug that is subject to investigation and approval under the act or the bio-logics provisions of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262–263). \\n(9) Marketing application means an ap-\\nplication for approval of a new drug filed under section 505(b) of the act or an application for a biologics license submitted under section 351 of the Pub-lic Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262). \\n(10) Orphan drug means a drug in-\\ntended for use in a rare disease or con-dition as defined in section 526 of the act. \\n(11) Orphan-drug designation means \\nFDA’s act of granting a request for des-ignation under section 526 of the act. \\n(12) Orphan-drug exclusive approval or \\nexclusive approval means that, effective \\non the date of FDA approval as stated in the approval letter of a marketing application for a sponsor of a des-\\nignated orphan drug, no approval will be given to a subsequent sponsor of the same drug for the same use or indica-tion for 7 years, except as otherwise provided by law or in this part.

For drug products that are not in-\\ntended to be absorbed into the blood-stream, bioavailability may be as-sessed by scientifically valid measure-ments intended to reflect the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of action. \\n(2) Statistical techniques used must \\nbe of sufficient sensitivity to detect differences in rate and extent of ab-sorption that are not attributable to subject variability. \\n(3) A drug product that differs from \\nthe reference material in its rate of ab-sorption, but not in its extent of ab-sorption, may be considered to be bio-available if the difference in the rate of absorption is intentional, is appro-priately reflected in the labeling, is not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on chronic use, and is considered medically insig-nificant for the drug product. \\n(b)(1) Two drug products will be con-\\nsidered bioequivalent drug products if they are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives whose rate and extent of absorption do not show a significant difference when ad-ministered at the same molar dose of the active moiety under similar experi-mental conditions, either single dose or multiple dose. Some pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alter-natives may be equivalent in the ex-tent of their absorption but not in their rate of absorption and yet may be considered bioequivalent because such differences in the rate of absorption are intentional and are reflected in the la-beling, are not essential to the attain-ment of effective body drug concentra-tions on chronic use, and are consid-ered medically insignificant for the particular drug product studied. (2) For drug products that are not in-\\ntended to be absorbed into the blood-stream, bioequivalence may be dem-onstrated by scientifically valid meth-ods that are expected to detect a sig-nificant difference between the drug and the listed drug in safety and thera-peutic effect. \\n[57 FR 17999, Apr. 28, 1992, as amended at 67 \\nFR 77673, Dec. 19, 2002, 81 FR 69658, Oct. 6, 2016] \\n§ 320.24 Types of evidence to measure \\nbioavailability or establish bio-equivalence. \\n(a) Bioavailability may be measured \\nor bioequivalence may be dem-onstrated by several in vivo and in vitro methods. FDA may require in vivo or in vitro testing, or both, to measure the bioavailability of a drug product or establish the bioequivalence of specific drug products. Information on bioequivalence requirements for specific products is included in the cur-rent edition of FDA’s publication ‘‘Ap-proved Drug Products with Thera-peutic Equivalence Evaluations’’ and any current supplement to the publica-tion. The selection of the method used to meet an in vivo or in vitro testing requirement depends upon the purpose of the study, the analytical methods available, and the nature of the drug product. Applicants shall conduct bio-availability and bioequivalence testing using the most accurate, sensitive, and reproducible approach available among those set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The method used must be ca-pable of measuring bioavailability or establishing bioequivalence, as appro-priate, for the product being tested. \\n(b) The following in vivo and in vitro \\napproaches, in descending order of ac-curacy, sensitivity, and reproduc-ibility, are acceptable for determining the bioavailability or bioequivalence of a drug product. \\n(1)(i) An in vivo test in humans in \\nwhich the concentration of the active ingredient or active moiety, and, when appropriate, its active metabolite(s), in whole blood, plasma, serum, or other appropriate biological fluid is meas-ured as a function of time.

The intervals at which measurements are taken should ordinarily be as short as possible so that the measure of the rate of elimi-nation is as accurate as possible. De-pending on the nature of the drug prod-uct, this approach may be applicable to the category of dosage forms described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. This method is not appropriate where urinary excretion is not a significant mechanism of elimination. \\n(3) An in vivo test in humans in \\nwhich an appropriate acute pharma-cological effect of the active moiety, and, when appropriate, its active me-tabolite(s), are measured as a function of time if such effect can be measured with sufficient accuracy, sensitivity, and reproducibility. This approach is applicable to the category of dosage forms described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section only when appropriate methods are not available for measure-ment of the concentration of the moi-ety, and, when appropriate, its active metabolite(s), in biological fluids or ex-cretory products but a method is avail-able for the measurement of an appro-priate acute pharmacological effect. This approach may be particularly ap-plicable to dosage forms that are not intended to deliver the active moiety to the bloodstream for systemic dis-tribution. \\n(4) Well-controlled clinical trials that \\nestablish the safety and effectiveness of the drug product, for purposes of measuring bioavailability, or appro-priately designed comparative clinical trials, for purposes of demonstrating bioequivalence. This approach is the least accurate, sensitive, and reproduc-ible of the general approaches for measuring bioavailability or dem-onstrating bioequivalence. For dosage forms intended to deliver the active moiety to the bloodstream for systemic distribution, this approach may be con-sidered acceptable only when analyt-ical methods cannot be developed to \\npermit use of one of the approaches outlined in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(2) of this section, when the ap-proaches described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), and (b)(3) of this section are not available. This ap-proach may also be considered suffi-ciently accurate for measuring bio-availability or demonstrating bio-equivalence of dosage forms intended to deliver the active moiety locally, e.g., topical preparations for the skin, eye, and mucous membranes; oral dos-age forms not intended to be absorbed, e.g., an antacid or radiopaque medium; and bronchodilators administered by inhalation if the onset and duration of pharmacological activity are defined. \\n(5) A currently available in vitro test \\nacceptable to FDA (usually a dissolu-tion rate test) that ensures human in vivo bioavailability. \\n(6) Any other approach deemed ade-\\nquate by FDA to measure bio-availability or establish bioequiva-lence. \\n(c) FDA may, notwithstanding prior \\nrequirements for measuring bio-availability or establishing bioequiva-lence, require in vivo testing in hu-mans of a product at any time if the agency has evidence that the product: \\n(1) May not produce therapeutic ef-\\nfects comparable to a pharmaceutical equivalent or alternative with which it is intended to be used interchangeably; \\n(2) May not be bioequivalent to a \\npharmaceutical equivalent or alter-native with which it is intended to be used interchangeably; or \\n(3) Has greater than anticipated po-\\ntential toxicity related to pharmaco-kinetic or other characteristics. \\n[57 FR 17999, Apr. 28, 1992; 57 FR 29354, July \\n1, 1992, as amended at 67 FR 77673, Dec. 19, 2002] \\n§ 320.25 Guidelines for the conduct of \\nan in vivo bioavailability study. \\n(a) Guiding principles.

Critically ill patients shall not be included in an in vivo bio-availability study unless the attending physician determines that there is a potential benefit to the patient. \\n(b) Basic design. The basic design of \\nan in vivo bioavailability study is de-termined by the following: \\n(1) The scientific questions to be an-\\nswered. \\n(2) The nature of the reference mate-\\nrial and the dosage form to be tested. \\n(3) The availability of analytical \\nmethods. \\n(4) Benefit-risk considerations in re-\\ngard to testing in humans. \\n(c) Comparison to a reference material. \\nIn vivo bioavailability testing of a drug product shall be in comparison to an appropriate reference material unless some other approach is more appro-priate for valid scientific reasons. \\n(d) Previously unmarketed active drug \\ningredients or therapeutic moieties. (1) An \\nin vivo bioavailability study involving a drug product containing an active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety that has not been approved for mar-keting can be used to measure the fol-lowing pharmacokinetic data: \\n(i) The bioavailability of the formu-\\nlation proposed for marketing; and \\n(ii) The essential pharmacokinetic \\ncharacteristics of the active drug in-gredient or therapeutic moiety, such as the rate of absorption, the extent of ab-sorption, the half-life of the thera-peutic moiety in vivo, and the rate of excretion and/or metabolism. Dose pro-portionality of the active drug ingre-dient or the therapeutic moiety needs to be established after single-dose ad-ministration and in certain instances after multiple-dose administration. This characterization is a necessary part of the investigation of the drug to support drug labeling. \\n(2) The reference material in such a \\nbioavailability study should be a solu-tion or suspension containing the same quantity of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety as the formula-tion proposed for marketing. \\n(3) The reference material should be \\nadministered by the same route as the formulation proposed for marketing unless an alternative or additional \\nroute is necessary to answer the sci-entific question under study. For ex-ample, in the case of an active drug in-gredient or therapeutic moiety that is poorly absorbed after oral administra-tion, it may be necessary to compare the oral dosage form proposed for mar-keting with the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety administered in solution both orally and intravenously. \\n(e) New formulations of active drug in-\\ngredients or therapeutic moieties approved for marketing. (1) An in vivo bio-\\navailability study involving a drug product that is a new dosage form, or a new salt or ester of an active drug in-gredient or therapeutic moiety that has been approved for marketing can be used to: \\n(i) Measure the bioavailability of the \\nnew formulation, new dosage form, or new salt or ester relative to an appro-priate reference material; and \\n(ii) Define the pharmacokinetic pa-\\nrameters of the new formulation, new dosage form, or new salt or ester to es-tablish dosage recommendation. \\n(2) The selection of the reference ma-\\nterial(s) in such a bioavailability study depends upon the scientific questions to be answered, the data needed to es-tablish comparability to a currently marketed drug product, and the data needed to establish dosage rec-ommendations. \\n(3) The reference material should be \\ntaken from a current batch of a drug product that is the subject of an ap-proved new drug application and that contains the same active drug ingre-dient or therapeutic moiety, if the new formulation, new dosage form, or new salt or ester is intended to be com-parable to or to meet any comparative labeling claims made in relation to the drug product that is the subject of an approved new drug application. \\n(f) Extended release formulations. (1) \\nThe purpose of an in vivo bio-availability study involving a drug product for which an extended release claim is made is to determine if all of the following conditions are met: \\n(i) The drug product meets the ex-\\ntended release claims made for it. \\n(ii) The bioavailability profile estab-\\nlished for the drug product rules out the occurrence of any dose dumping. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00221 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '207', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The reference material shall be one of the following or any combination thereof: \\n(i) A solution or suspension of the ac-\\ntive drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety. \\n(ii) A currently marketed noncon-\\ntrolled release drug product containing the same active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety and administered according to the dosage recommenda-tions in the labeling of the noncon-trolled release drug product. \\n(iii) A currently marketed extended \\nrelease drug product subject to an ap-proved full new drug application con-taining the same active drug ingre-dient or therapeutic moiety and admin-istered according to the dosage rec-ommendations in the labeling proposed for the extended release drug product. \\n(iv) A reference material other than \\none set forth in paragraph (f)(2) (i), (ii) or (iii) of this section that is appro-priate for valid scientific reasons. \\n(g) Combination drug products. (1) Gen-\\nerally, the purpose of an in vivo bio-availability study involving a combina-tion drug product is to determine if the rate and extent of absorption of each active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety in the combination drug prod-uct is equivalent to the rate and extent of absorption of each active drug ingre-dient or therapeutic moiety adminis-tered concurrently in separate single- ingredient preparations. \\n(2) The reference material in such a \\nbioavailability study should be two or more currently marketed, single-ingre-dient drug products each of which con-tains one of the active drug ingredients or therapeutic moieties in the com-bination drug product. The Food and \\nDrug Administration may, for valid scientific reasons, specify that the ref-erence material shall be a combination drug product that is the subject of an approved new drug application. \\n(3) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion may permit a bioavailability study involving a combination drug product to determine the rate and ex-tent of absorption of selected, but not all, active drug ingredients or thera-peutic moieties in the combination drug product. The Food and Drug Ad-ministration may permit this deter-mination if the pharmacokinetics and the interactions of the active drug in-gredients or therapeutic moieties in the combination drug product are well known and the therapeutic activity of the combination drug product is gen-erally recognized to reside in only one of the active drug ingredients or thera-peutic moieties, e.g., ampicillin in an ampicillin-probenecid combination drug product. \\n(h) Use of a placebo as the reference \\nmaterial. Where appropriate or where \\nnecessary to demonstrate the sensi-tivity of the test, the reference mate-rial in a bioavailability study may be a placebo if: \\n(1) The study measures the thera-\\npeutic or acute pharmacological effect of the active drug ingredient or thera-peutic moiety; or \\n(2) The study is a clinical trial to es-\\ntablish the safety and effectiveness of the drug product. \\n(i) Standards for test drug product and \\nreference material. (1) Both the drug \\nproduct to be tested and the reference material, if it is another drug product, shall be shown to meet all compendial or other applicable standards of iden-tity, strength, quality, and purity, in-\\ncluding potency and, where applicable, content uniformity, disintegration times, and dissolution rates. \\n(2) Samples of the drug product to be \\ntested shall be manufactured using the same equipment and under the same conditions as those used for full-scale production. \\n[42 FR 1648, Jan. 7, 1977, as amended at 67 FR \\n77674, Dec. 19, 2002] \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00222 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '208', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(1) An in vivo bio-\\navailability or bioequivalence study should be a single-dose comparison of the drug product to be tested and the appropriate reference material con-ducted in normal adults. \\n(2) The test product and the reference \\nmaterial should be administered to subjects in the fasting state, unless some other approach is more appro-priate for valid scientific reasons. \\n(b) Study design. (1) A single-dose \\nstudy should be crossover in design, unless a parallel design or other design is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons, and should provide for a drug elimination period. \\n(2) Unless some other approach is ap-\\npropriate for valid scientific reasons, the drug elimination period should be either: \\n(i) At least three times the half-life \\nof the active drug ingredient or thera-peutic moiety, or its metabolite(s), measured in the blood or urine; or \\n(ii) At least three times the half-life \\nof decay of the acute pharmacological effect. \\n(c) Collection of blood samples. (1) \\nWhen comparison of the test product and the reference material is to be based on blood concentration time curves, unless some other approach is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons, blood samples should be taken with sufficient frequency to permit an estimate of both: \\n(i) The peak concentration in the \\nblood of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, or its metabo-lite(s), measured; and \\n(ii) The total area under the curve for \\na time period at least three times the half-life of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, or its metabo-lite(s), measured. \\n(2) In a study comparing oral dosage \\nforms, the sampling times should be identical. \\n(3) In a study comparing an intra-\\nvenous dosage form and an oral dosage form, the sampling times should be those needed to describe both: \\n(i) The distribution and elimination \\nphase of the intravenous dosage form; and (ii) The absorption and elimination \\nphase of the oral dosage form. \\n(4) In a study comparing drug deliv-\\nery systems other than oral or intra-venous dosage forms with an appro-priate reference standard, the sampling \\ntimes should be based on valid sci-entific reasons. \\n(d) Collection of urine samples.

(1) A multiple-dose \\nstudy should be crossover in design, unless a parallel design or other design is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons, and should provide for a drug elimination period if steady-state con-ditions are not achieved. \\n(2) A multiple-dose study is not re-\\nquired to be of crossover design if the study is to establish dose proportion-ality under a multiple-dose regimen or to establish the pharmacokinetic pro-file of a new drug product, a new drug delivery system, or an extended release dosage form. \\n(3) If a drug elimination period is re-\\nquired, unless some other approach is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons, the drug elimination period should be either: \\n(i) At least five times the half-life of \\nthe active drug ingredient or thera-peutic moiety, or its active metabo-lite(s), measured in the blood or urine; or \\n(ii) At least five times the half-life of \\ndecay of the acute pharmacological ef-fect. \\n(c) Achievement of steady-state condi-\\ntions. Whenever a multiple-dose study \\nis conducted, unless some other ap-proach is more appropriate for valid scientific reasons, sufficient doses of the test product and reference material should be administered in accordance with the labeling to achieve steady- state conditions. \\n(d) Collection of blood or urine samples. \\n(1) Whenever comparison of the test product and the reference material is to be based on blood concentration- \\ntime curves at steady state, appro-priate dosage administration and sam-pling should be carried out to docu-ment attainment of steady state. \\n(2) Whenever comparison of the test \\nproduct and the reference material is to be based on cumulative urinary ex-cretion-time curves at steady state, ap-propriate dosage administration and sampling should be carried out to docu-ment attainment of steady state. \\n(3) A more complete characterization \\nof the blood concentration or urinary excretion rate during the absorption and elimination phases of a single dose administered at steady-state is encour-aged to permit estimation of the total area under concentration-time curves or cumulative urinary excretion-time curves and to obtain pharmacokinetic information, e.g., half-life or blood clearance, that is essential in pre-paring adequate labeling for the drug product. \\n(e) Steady-state parameters. (1) In cer-\\ntain instances, e.g., in a study involv-ing a new drug entity, blood clearances at steady-state obtained in a multiple- dose study should be compared to blood clearances obtained in a single-dose study to support adequate dosage rec-ommendations. \\n(2) In a linear system, the area under \\nthe blood concentration-time curve during a dosing interval in a multiple- dose steady-state study is directly pro-portional to the fraction of the dose ab-sorbed and is equal to the cor-responding ‘‘zero to infinity’’ area under the curve for a single-dose study. Therefore, when steady-state condi-tions are achieved, a comparison of blood concentrations during a dosing interval may be used to define the frac-tion of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety absorbed. \\n(3) Other methods based on valid sci-\\nentific reasons should be used to deter-mine the bioavailability of a drug prod-uct having dose-dependent kinetics (non-linear system). \\n(f) Measurement of an acute pharma-\\ncological effect.

(c) Evidence that the drug products \\nexhibit a narrow therapeutic ratio, e.g., there is less than a 2-fold dif-ference in median lethal dose (LD\\n50) \\nand median effective dose (ED 50) val-\\nues, or have less than a 2-fold dif-ference in the minimum toxic con-centrations and minimum effective concentrations in the blood, and safe and effective use of the drug products requires careful dosage titration and patient monitoring. \\n(d) Competent medical determination \\nthat a lack of bioequivalence would have a serious adverse effect in the treatment or prevention of a serious disease or condition. \\n(e) Physicochemical evidence that: (1) The active drug ingredient has a \\nlow solubility in water, e.g., less than 5 milligrams per 1 milliliter, or, if dis-solution in the stomach is critical to absorption, the volume of gastric fluids required to dissolve the recommended dose far exceeds the volume of fluids present in the stomach (taken to be 100 milliliters for adults and prorated for infants and children). \\n(2) The dissolution rate of one or \\nmore such products is slow, e.g., less than 50 percent in 30 minutes when tested using either a general method specified in an official compendium or a paddle method at 50 revolutions per minute in 900 milliliters of distilled or deionized water at 37 °C, or differs sig-\\nnificantly from that of an appropriate reference material such as an identical drug product that is the subject of an approved full new drug application. \\n(3) The particle size and/or surface \\narea of the active drug ingredient is critical in determining its bio-availability. \\n(4) Certain physical structural char-\\nacteristics of the active drug ingre-dient, e.g., polymorphic forms, con-forms, solvates, complexes, and crystal modifications, dissolve poorly and this poor dissolution may affect absorption. \\n(5) Such drug products have a high \\nratio of excipients to active ingredi-ents, e.g., greater than 5 to 1. \\n(6) Specific inactive ingredients, e.g., \\nhydrophilic or hydrophobic excipients and lubricants, either may be required \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00227 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '213', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

An advisory review panel will \\nmeet as often and for as long as is ap-propriate to review the data submitted to it and to prepare a report containing its conclusions and recommendations to the Commissioner with respect to the safety and effectiveness of the drugs in a designated category of OTC drugs. A panel may consult any indi-vidual or group. Any interested person may request an opportunity to present oral views to the panel; such request may be granted or denied by the panel. Such requests for oral presentations should be in written form including a summarization of the data to be pre-sented to the panel. Any interested person may present written data and views which shall be considered by the panel.

The advisory review panel, \\nin reviewing the data submitted to it and preparing its conclusions and rec-ommendations, and the Commissioner, in reviewing the conclusions and rec-ommendations of the panel and the published proposed, tentative, and the final monographs, shall apply the fol-lowing standards to determine general recognition that a category of OTC drugs is safe and effective and not mis-branded: (i) Safety means a low incidence of \\nadverse reactions or significant side ef-fects under adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use as well as low potential for harm which may result from abuse under condi-tions of widespread availability. Proof of safety shall consist of adequate tests by methods reasonably applicable to show the drug is safe under the pre-scribed, recommended, or suggested conditions of use. This proof shall in-clude results of significant human ex-perience during marketing. General recognition of safety shall ordinarily be based upon published studies which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data. \\n(ii) Effectiveness means a reasonable \\nexpectation that, in a significant pro-portion of the target population, the pharmacological effect of the drug, when used under adequate directions for use and warnings against unsafe use, will provide clinically significant relief of the type claimed. Proof of ef-fectiveness shall consist of controlled clinical investigations as defined in §314.126(b) of this chapter, unless this requirement is waived on the basis of a showing that it is not reasonably appli-cable to the drug or essential to the va-lidity of the investigation and that an alternative method of investigation is adequate to substantiate effectiveness. Investigations may be corroborated by partially controlled or uncontrolled studies, documented clinical studies by qualified experts, and reports of signifi-cant human experience during mar-keting. Isolated case reports, random experience, and reports lacking the de-tails which permit scientific evalua-tion will not be considered. General recognition of effectiveness shall ordi-narily be based upon published studies which may be corroborated by unpub-lished studies and other data. \\n(iii) The benefit-to-risk ratio of a \\ndrug shall be considered in determining safety and effectiveness. \\n(iv) An OTC drug may combine two \\nor more safe and effective active ingre-dients and may be generally recognized as safe and effective when each active ingredient makes a contribution to the claimed effect(s); when combining of the active ingredients does not de-crease the safety or effectiveness of \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00238 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '224', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

It shall state the intended uses and re-sults of the product; adequate direc-tions for proper use; and warnings against unsafe use, side effects, and ad-verse reactions in such terms as to render them likely to be read and un-derstood by the ordinary individual, in-cluding individuals of low comprehen-sion, under customary conditions of purchase and use. \\n(vi) A drug shall be permitted for \\nOTC sale and use by the laity unless, because of its toxicity or other poten-tial for harmful effect or because of the method or collateral measures nec-essary to its use, it may safely be sold and used only under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to ad-minister such drugs. \\n(5) Advisory review panel report to the \\nCommissioner. An advisory review panel \\nmay submit to the Commissioner a re-port containing its conclusions and recommendations with respect to the conditions under which OTC drugs fall-ing within the category covered by the panel are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. In-cluded within this report shall be: \\n(i) A recommended monograph or \\nmonographs covering the category of OTC drugs and establishing conditions under which the drugs involved are generally recognized as safe and effec-tive and not misbranded (Category I). This monograph may include any con-ditions relating to active ingredients, labeling indications, warnings and ade-quate directions for use, prescription or OTC status, and any other condi-tions necessary and appropriate for the safety and effectiveness of drugs cov-ered by the monograph. \\n(ii) A statement of active ingredi-\\nents, labeling claims or other state-ments, or other conditions reviewed and excluded from the monograph on the basis of the panel’s determination that they would result in the drug’s not being generally recognized as safe \\nand effective or would result in mis-branding (Category II). \\n(iii) A statement of active ingredi-\\nents, labeling claims or other state-ments, or other conditions reviewed and excluded from the monograph on the basis of the panel’s determination that the available data are insufficient to classify such condition under either paragraph (a)(5) (i) or (ii) of this sec-tion and for which further testing is therefore required (Category III). The report may recommend the type of fur-ther testing required and the time pe-riod within which it might reasonably be concluded. \\n(6) Proposed monograph. After review-\\ning the conclusions and recommenda-tions of the advisory review panel, the Commissioner shall publish in the F\\nED-\\nERAL REGISTER a proposed order con-\\ntaining: \\n(i) A monograph or monographs es-\\ntablishing conditions under which a category of OTC drugs or a specific or specific OTC drugs are generally recog-nized as safe and effective and not mis-branded (Category I). \\n(ii) A statement of the conditions ex-\\ncluded from the monograph on the basis of the Commissioner’s determina-tion that they would result in the drug’s not being generally recognized as safe and effective or would result in misbranding (Category II). \\n(iii) A statement of the conditions \\nexcluded from the monograph on the basis of the Commissioner’s determina-tion that the available data are insuffi-cient to classify such conditions under either paragraph (a)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section (Category III). \\n(iv) The full report(s) of the panel to \\nthe Commissioner. The proposed order shall specify a reasonable period of time within which conditions falling within paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this sec-tion may be continued in marketed products while the data necessary to support them are being obtained for evaluation by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration.

Within 30 days after the final day for submission of comments, reply comments may be filed with the Divi-sion of Dockets Management; these comments shall be utilized to reply to comments made by other interested persons and not to reiterate a position. The Commissioner may satisfy this re-quirement by publishing in the F\\nED-\\nERAL REGISTER a proposed order sum-\\nmarizing the full report of the advisory review panel, containing its conclu-sions and recommendations, to obtain full public comment before under-taking his own evaluation and decision on the matters involved. \\n(7) Tentative final monograph.

Within 90 days, any inter-ested person may file with the Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, written com-ments or written objections specifying with particularity the omissions or ad-ditions requested. These objections are to be supported by a brief statement of the grounds therefor. A request for an oral hearing may accompany such ob-jections. \\n(ii) The Commissioner may also pub-\\nlish in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER a sepa-\\nrate tentative order containing a state-ment of those active ingredients re-viewed and proposed to be excluded from the monograph on the basis of the Commissioner’s determination that they would result in a drug product not being generally recognized as safe and effective or would result in mis-branding. This order may be published when no substantive comments in op-position to the panel report or new data and information were received by \\nthe Food and Drug Administration under paragraph (a)(6)(iv) of this sec-tion or when the Commissioner has evaluated and concurs with a panel’s recommendation that a condition be \\nexcluded from the monograph. Within 90 days, any interested person may file with the Division of Dockets Manage-ment, Food and Drug Administration, written objections specifying with par-ticularity the provision of the ten-tative order to which objection is made. These objections are to be sup-ported by a brief statement of the grounds therefor. A request for an oral hearing may accompany such objec-tions. \\n(iii) Within 12 months after pub-\\nlishing a tentative order pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, any interested person may file with the Di-vision of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, new data and information to support a condition excluded from the monograph in the tentative order. \\n(iv) Within 60 days after the final day \\nfor submission of new data and infor-mation, comments on the new data and information may be filed with the Divi-sion of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration. \\n(v) New data and information sub-\\nmitted after the time specified in this paragraph but prior to the establish-ment of a final monograph will be con-sidered as a petition to amend the monograph and will be considered by the Commissioner only after a final monograph has been published in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER unless the \\nCommisisoner finds that good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration. \\n(8) Oral hearing before the Commis-\\nsioner.

After reviewing \\nthe objections, the entire administra-tive record including all new data and information and comments, and consid-ering the arguments made at any oral hearing, the Commissioner shall pub-lish in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER a final \\norder containing a monograph estab-lishing conditions under which a cat-egory of OTC drugs or a specific or spe-cific OTC drugs are generally recog-nized as safe and effective and not mis-branded. The monograph shall become effective as specified in the order. \\n(10) Administrative record.

In the interim it is in the public inter-est that manufacturers and distribu-tors of all OTC drugs effect changes in their formulations and/or labeling to bring the products into conformity with current medical knowledge and experience. \\n(d) Manufacturers and distributors of \\nOTC drugs may be reluctant to make appropriate formulation and/or label-ing changes for fear of losing the pro-tection of the so-called ‘‘grandfather’’ provisions of the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 201(p)(1)) and the 1962 amendments to the act (sec. 107(c) of those amendments). To encourage and facilitate prompt changes, the Food and Drug Adminis-tration will not take legal action against any OTC drug, other than those not deferred, based on a charge that the product is a new drug and not grandfathered under the act as a result of the changes if the changes in formu-lation and/or labeling are of the fol-lowing kind: \\n(1) The addition to the labeling of \\nwarning, contraindications, side ef-fects, and/or precaution information. \\n(2) The deletion from the labeling of \\nfalse, misleading, or unsupported indi-cations for use or claims of effective-ness. \\n(3) Changes in the components or \\ncomposition of the drug that will give increased assurance that the drug will have its intended effect, yet not raise or contribute any added safety ques-tions. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00244 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '230', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

State whether the current product labeling has or has not been author-ized, accepted, or approved by a regu-latory body in each country where the condition is marketed. \\n(4) For a condition that has been \\nmarketed OTC in five or more coun-tries with a minimum of 5 continuous \\nyears of marketing in at least one country, the sponsor may select at least five of these countries from which to submit information in accord with paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv) of this section. Selected countries must include the country with a minimum of 5 continuous years of OTC marketing, countries that have the longest dura-tion of marketing, and countries hav-ing the most support for extent of mar-keting, i.e., a large volume of sales \\nwith cultural diversity among users of the product. If the condition meets these criteria in countries listed in sec-tion 802(b)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, some of these countries should be included among the five selected. Sponsors should provide information from more than five coun-tries if they believe that it is needed to support eligibility. Sponsors should ex-plain the basis for the countries se-lected in the TEA. \\n(5) A list of all countries where the \\ncondition is marketed only as a pre-scription drug and the reasons why its marketing is restricted to prescription in these countries. \\n(6) A list of all countries in which the \\ncondition has been withdrawn from marketing or in which an application for OTC marketing approval has been denied. Include the reasons for such withdrawal or application denial. \\n(7) The information requested in \\nparagraphs (c)(2), (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(iv), and (c)(3) of this section must be provided in a table format. The la-beling required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section must be attached to the table. \\n(8) For OTC drugs that have been \\nmarketed for more than 5 years in the United States under a new drug appli-cation, the information requested in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(v), (c)(3), and (c)(5) of this section need not be provided. \\n(d) Submission of information ; confiden-\\ntiality.

If the \\ncondition is found eligible, the TEA will be placed on public display in the Division of Dockets Management after deletion of information deemed con-fidential under 18 U.S.C. 1905, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), or 21 U.S.C. 331(j). Sponsors must identify information that is con-sidered confidential under these statu-tory provisions. If the condition is not found eligible, the TEA will not be placed on public display, but a letter from the agency to the sponsor stating why the condition was not found ac-ceptable will be placed on public dis-play in the Division of Dockets Man-agement. \\n(e) Notice of eligibility. If the condition \\nis found eligible, the agency will pub-lish a notice of eligibility in the F\\nED-\\nERAL REGISTER and provide the sponsor \\nand other interested parties an oppor-tunity to submit data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. When the no-tice of eligibility is published, the agency will place the TEA on public display in the Division of Dockets Man-agement. \\n(f) Safety and effectiveness data submis-\\nsion. The notice of eligibility will re-\\nquest a safety and effectiveness data submission that includes published and unpublished data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the condi-tion for its intended OTC use(s), as well as the submission of any other relevant data and views. These data will be sub-mitted to a docket established in the Division of Dockets Management and will be publicly available for viewing at that office, except data deemed con-fidential under 18 U.S.C. 1905, 5 U.S.C. 552(b), or 21 U.S.C. 331(j). Data consid-ered confidential under these provi-sions must be clearly identified. Any proposed compendial standards for the condition will not be considered con-fidential. The safety and effectiveness data submission must be sufficiently complete to be filed by the agency under paragraph (j)(2) of this section. Safety and effectiveness data and other information submitted under this para-graph are subject to the requirements in §330.10(c), (e), and (f). The safety and effectiveness data submission must in-clude the following: \\n(1) All data and information listed in \\n§330.10(a)(2) under the outline ‘‘OTC Drug Review Information,’’ items III \\nthrough VII. \\n(2) All serious adverse drug experi-\\nences as defined in §§310.305 and 314.80 of this chapter, from each country where the condition has been or is cur-rently marketed as a prescription drug or as an OTC drug or product. Provide individual adverse drug experience re-ports (FDA Form 3500A or equivalent) along with a summary of all serious ad-verse drug experiences and expected or frequently reported side effects for the condition. Individual reports that are not in English must be translated to English in accordance with §10.20(c)(2) of this chapter. \\n(g) Administrative procedures. The \\nagency may use an advisory review panel to evaluate the safety and effec-tiveness data in accord with the provi-sions of §330.10(a)(3). Alternatively, the agency may evaluate the data in con-junction with the advisory review panel or on its own without using an advisory review panel. The agency will use the safety, effectiveness, and label-ing standards in §330.10(a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(vi) in evaluating the data. \\n(1) If the agency uses an advisory re-\\nview panel to evaluate the data, the panel may submit its recommendations in its official minutes of meeting(s) or by a report under the provisions of §330.10(a)(5). \\n(2) The agency may act on an advi-\\nsory review panel’s recommendations \\nusing the procedures in §§330.10(a)(2) and 330.10(a)(6) through (a)(10). \\n(3) If the condition is initially deter-\\nmined to be generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC use in the United States, the agency will propose to include it in an appropriate OTC drug monograph(s), either by amending an existing monograph(s) or estab-lishing a new monograph(s), if nec-essary. \\n(4) If the condition is initially deter-\\nmined not to be GRASE for OTC use in the United States, the agency will in-form the sponsor and other interested persons who have submitted data of its determination by feedback letter, a copy of which will be placed on public display in the docket established in the Division of Dockets Management.

The agency will subsequently publish a final rule (or reproposal if necessary) in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER . \\n(h) Marketing. A condition submitted \\nunder this section for consideration in the OTC drug monograph system may be marketed in accordance with an ap-plicable final OTC drug monograph(s) only after the agency determines that the condition is generally recognized as safe and effective and includes it in the appropriate OTC drug final mono-graph(s), and the condition complies with paragraph (i) of this section. When an OTC drug monograph has not been finalized and finalization is not imminent, after the agency has evalu-ated the comments to a proposed rule to include a new condition in a ten-tative final monograph as generally recognized as safe and effective and the agency has not changed its position as a result of the comments, and the con-dition complies with paragraph (i) of this section, the agency may publish a notice of enforcement policy that al-lows marketing to begin pending com-pletion of the final monograph subject to the risk that the agency may, prior to or in the final monograph, adopt a different position that could require re-labeling, recall, or other regulatory ac-tion. \\n(i) Compendial monograph. Any active \\ningredient or botanical drug substance included in a final OTC drug mono-graph or the subject of an enforcement notice described in paragraph (h) of this section must be recognized in an official USP-NF drug monograph that sets forth its standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity. Sponsors must include an official or proposed compendial monograph as part of the safety and effectiveness data submis-sion listed in §330.10(a)(2) under item VII of the outline entitled ‘‘OTC DRUG REVIEW INFORMATION.’’ \\n(j) Filing determination. (1) After FDA \\nreceives a safety and effectiveness data submission, the agency will determine whether the submission may be filed. The filing of a submission means that FDA has made a threshold determina-tion that the submission is sufficiently \\ncomplete to permit a substantive re-view. \\n(2) If FDA finds that none of the rea-\\nsons in paragraph (j)(4) of this section for refusing to file the safety and effec-tiveness data submission apply, the agency will file the submission and no-tify the submitter in writing. FDA will post a copy of the notice to the docket. The date of filing begins the FDA timelines described in §330.15(c)(3) and (4). Data submitted after the date of filing will be considered before the issuance of a notice of proposed rule-making if there is adequate time for review; otherwise, the data will be con-sidered as comments to the proposed rule after issuance of a notice of pro-posed rulemaking. \\n(3) If FDA refuses to file the safety \\nand effectiveness data submission, the \\nagency will notify the submitter in writing and state the reason(s) under paragraph (j)(4) of this section for the refusal. The submitter may request in writing, within 30 days of the date of the agency’s notification, a meeting with the agency about whether the agency should file the submission, and FDA will convene the meeting within 30 days of the request. If, within 120 days after the meeting, the submitter requests that FDA file the submission (with or without correcting the defi-ciencies), the agency will file the safe-ty and effectiveness data submission over protest under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, notify the submitter in writing and post a copy to the docket, and review the submission as filed. The submitter must have a meeting before requesting that FDA file the submis-sion over protest but need not resubmit a copy of a safety and effectiveness data submission that is filed over pro-test. A safety and effectiveness data submission and the corresponding TEA-eligible condition are both not deemed under consideration if FDA re-fuses to file the safety and effective-ness data submission, and it is not filed over protest; the condition remains eli-gible for consideration and the sponsor or any interested person can pursue consideration of the condition in the future by submitting a new safety and effectiveness data submission. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00250 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '236', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

(i) \\nProlonged use of aluminum-containing antacids in patients with renal failure may result in or worsen dialysis osteo-malacia. Elevated tissue aluminum levels contribute to the development of the dialysis encephalopathy and osteo-malacia syndromes. Small amounts of aluminum are absorbed from the gas-trointestinal tract and renal excretion of aluminum is impaired in renal fail-ure. Aluminum is not well removed by dialysis because it is bound to albumin and transferrin, which do not cross di-alysis membranes. As a result, alu-minum is deposited in bone, and dialy-sis osteomalacia may develop when large amounts of aluminum are in-gested orally by patients with impaired renal function. \\n(ii) Aluminum forms insoluble com-\\nplexes with phosphate in the gastro-intestinal tract, thus decreasing phos-phate absorption. Prolonged use of alu-minum-containing antacids by normo-phosphatemic patients may result in hypophosphatemia if phosphate intake is not adequate. In its more severe forms, hypophosphatemia can lead to anorexia, malaise, muscle weakness, \\nand osteomalacia. \\n(b) Professional labeling for an ant-\\nacid-antiflatulent combination may contain the information allowed for health professionals for antacids and antiflatulents. \\n[39 FR 19874, June 4, 1974.

When exposed to moisture, aspirin hydrolyzes into salicylic and acetic acids, and gives off a vinegary-odor. It is highly lipid soluble and slightly soluble in water. \\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \\nMechanism of Action: Aspirin is a more po-\\ntent inhibitor of both prostaglandin syn-thesis and platelet aggregation than other salicylic acid derivatives. The differences in activity between aspirin and salicylic acid are thought to be due to the acetyl group on the aspirin molecule. This acetyl group is re-sponsible for the inactivation of cyclo- oxygenase via acetylation. \\nP\\nHARMACOKINETICS  \\nAbsorption: In general, immediate release \\naspirin is well and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Following ab-sorption, aspirin is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid with peak plasma levels of salicylic acid occurring within 1–2 hours of dosing (see P\\nHARMACOKINETICS —Metabolism ). The rate of \\nabsorption from the GI tract is dependent upon the dosage form, the presence or ab-sence of food, gastric pH (the presence or ab-sence of GI antacids or buffering agents), and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00296 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '282', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='287 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 343.80 \\nother physiologic factors. Enteric coated as-\\npirin products are erratically absorbed from the GI tract. \\nDistribution: Salicylic acid is widely dis-\\ntributed to all tissues and fluids in the body including the central nervous system (CNS), breast milk, and fetal tissues. The highest concentrations are found in the plasma, liver, renal cortex, heart, and lungs. The pro-tein binding of salicylate is concentration- dependent, i.e., nonlinear. At low concentra-\\ntions (<100 micrograms/milliliter ( μg/mL)), \\napproximately 90 percent of plasma salicy-late is bound to albumin while at higher con-centrations (>400 μg/mL), only about 75 per-\\ncent is bound. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma con-centrations approximating 200 μg/mL. Severe \\ntoxic effects are associated with levels >400 μg/mL. (See A\\nDVERSE REACTIONS and O VER-\\nDOSAGE .) \\nMetabolism: Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed \\nin the plasma to salicylic acid such that plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 1–2 hours after dosing. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glu-curonide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylic acid has a plasma half-life of approximately 6 hours. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10–20 grams (g)), the plasma half-life may be increased to over 20 hours. \\nElimination: The elimination of salicylic \\nacid follows zero order pharmacokinetics; (i.e., the rate of drug elimination is constant \\nin relation to plasma concentration). Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urine pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5 percent to >80 percent. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose. (See O\\nVERDOSAGE .) Following therapeutic \\ndoses, approximately 10 percent is found ex-creted in the urine as salicylic acid, 75 per-cent as salicyluric acid, and 10 percent phe-nolic and 5 percent acyl glucuronides of sali-cylic acid. \\nPharmacodynamics Aspirin affects platelet \\naggregation by irreversibly inhibiting prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor thromboxane A2. Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on platelet aggregation. At somewhat higher doses, aspirin reversibly in-hibits the formation of prostaglandin I\\n2 \\n(prostacyclin), which is an arterial vaso-dilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. At higher doses aspirin is an effective anti- \\ninflammatory agent, partially due to inhibi-tion of inflammatory mediators via cyclo- oxygenase inhibition in peripheral tissues. In vitro studies suggest that other mediators of inflammation may also be suppressed by as-pirin administration, although the precise mechanism of action has not been eluci-dated. It is this nonspecific suppression of cyclo-oxygenase activity in peripheral tis-sues following large doses that leads to its primary side effect of gastric irritation. (See A\\nDVERSE REACTIONS .) \\nCLINICAL STUDIES \\nIschemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic At-\\ntack (TIA): In clinical trials of subjects with \\nTIA’s due to fibrin platelet emboli or ischemic stroke, aspirin has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of the combined endpoint of stroke or death and the com-bined endpoint of TIA, stroke, or death by about 13–18 percent. \\nSuspected Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI): \\nIn a large, multi-center study of aspirin, streptokinase, and the combination of aspi-rin and streptokinase in 17,187 patients with suspected acute MI, aspirin treatment pro-duced a 23-percent reduction in the risk of vascular mortality. Aspirin was also shown to have an additional benefit in patients given a thrombolytic agent. \\nPrevention of Recurrent MI and Unstable An-\\ngina Pectoris: These indications are supported \\nby the results of six large, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials of predominantly male post-MI subjects and one randomized placebo-controlled study of men with unstable angina pectoris. Aspirin therapy in MI subjects was associated with a significant reduction (about 20 percent) in the risk of the combined endpoint of subse-quent death and/or nonfatal reinfarction in these patients. In aspirin-treated unstable angina patients the event rate was reduced to 5 percent from the 10 percent rate in the placebo group. \\nChronic Stable Angina Pectoris: In a random-\\nized, multi-center, double-blind trial de-\\nsigned to assess the role of aspirin for pre-vention of MI in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, aspirin significantly re-duced the primary combined endpoint of nonfatal MI, fatal MI, and sudden death by 34 percent. The secondary endpoint for vascular events (first occurrence of MI, stroke, or vas-cular death) was also significantly reduced (32 percent). \\nRevascularization Procedures: Most patients \\nwho undergo coronary artery revascularization procedures have already had symptomatic coronary artery disease for which aspirin is indicated. Similarly, pa-tients with lesions of the carotid bifurcation sufficient to require carotid endarterectomy \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00297 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '283', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

As-\\npirin is recommended for patients who un-dergo revascularization procedures if there is a preexisting condition for which aspirin is already indicated. \\nRheumatologic Diseases: In clinical studies \\nin patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juve-nile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spon-dylitis and osteoarthritis, aspirin has been shown to be effective in controlling various indices of clinical disease activity. \\nANIMAL TOXICOLOGY \\nThe acute oral 50 percent lethal dose in \\nrats is about 1.5 g/kilogram (kg) and in mice 1.1 g/kg. Renal papillary necrosis and de-creased urinary concentrating ability occur \\nin rodents chronically administered high doses. Dose-dependent gastric mucosal in-jury occurs in rats and humans. Mammals may develop aspirin toxicosis associated with GI symptoms, circulatory effects, and central nervous system depression. (See O\\nVERDOSAGE .) \\nINDICATIONS AND USAGE \\nVascular Indications (Ischemic Stroke, TIA, \\nAcute MI, Prevention of Recurrent MI, Unstable Angina Pectoris, and Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris): Aspirin is indicated to: (1) Reduce \\nthe combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli, (2) reduce the risk of vascular mortality in patients with a sus-pected acute MI, (3) reduce the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients with a previous MI or unstable angina pec-toris, and (4) reduce the combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. \\nRevascularization Procedures (Coronary Ar-\\ntery Bypass Graft (CABG), Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), and Carotid Endarterectomy): Aspirin is indi-\\ncated in patients who have undergone revascularization procedures ( i.e., CABG, \\nPTCA, or carotid endarterectomy) when there is a preexisting condition for which as-pirin is already indicated. \\nRheumatologic Disease Indications (Rheu-\\nmatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, Spondyloarthropathies, Osteoarthritis, and the Arthritis and Pleurisy of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)): Aspirin is indicated for \\nthe relief of the signs and symptoms of rheu-matoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthri-tis, osteoarthritis, spondyloarthropathies, and arthritis and pleurisy associated with SLE. \\nCONTRAINDICATIONS \\nAllergy: Aspirin is contraindicated in pa-\\ntients with known allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug products and in pa-tients with the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis, and nasal polyps. Aspirin may cause severe \\nurticaria, angioedema, or bronchospasm (asthma). \\nReye’s Syndrome: Aspirin should not be used \\nin children or teenagers for viral infections, with or without fever, because of the risk of Reye’s syndrome with concomitant use of as-pirin in certain viral illnesses. \\nWARNINGS \\nAlcohol Warning: Patients who consume \\nthree or more alcoholic drinks every day should be counseled about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin. \\nCoagulation Abnormalities: Even low doses \\nof aspirin can inhibit platelet function lead-ing to an increase in bleeding time. This can adversely affect patients with inherited (he-mophilia) or acquired (liver disease or vita-min K deficiency) bleeding disorders. \\nGI Side Effects: GI side effects include \\nstomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are com-mon and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Physicians should inform patients about the signs and symp-toms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. \\nPeptic Ulcer Disease: Patients with a his-\\ntory of active peptic ulcer disease should avoid using aspirin, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. \\nPRECAUTIONS \\nGeneral \\nRenal Failure: Avoid aspirin in patients \\nwith severe renal failure (glomerular filtra-tion rate less than 10 mL/minute). \\nHepatic Insufficiency: Avoid aspirin in pa-\\ntients with severe hepatic insufficiency. \\nSodium Restricted Diets: Patients with so-\\ndium-retaining states, such as congestive heart failure or renal failure, should avoid sodium-containing buffered aspirin prepara-tions because of their high sodium content. \\nLaboratory Tests \\nAspirin has been associated with elevated \\nhepatic enzymes, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, protein-uria, and prolonged bleeding time. \\nDrug Interactions \\nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibi-\\ntors: The hyponatremic and hypotensive ef-\\nfects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to its indirect effect on the renin- angiotensin conversion pathway. \\nAcetazolamide: Concurrent use of aspirin \\nand acetazolamide can lead to high serum \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00298 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '284', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolonga-tion of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anti-coagulant activity of heparin, increasing bleeding risk. \\nAnticonvulsants: Salicylate can displace \\nprotein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentra-tion of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels. \\nBeta Blockers: The hypotensive effects of \\nbeta blockers may be diminished by the con-comitant administration of aspirin due to in-hibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow, and salt and fluid retention. \\nDiuretics: The effectiveness of diuretics in \\npatients with underlying renal or cardio-vascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. \\nMethotrexate: Salicylate can inhibit renal \\nclearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or \\nrenal impaired. \\nNonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs \\n(NSAID’s): The concurrent use of aspirin with \\nother NSAID’s should be avoided because this may increase bleeding or lead to de-creased renal function. \\nOral Hypoglycemics: Moderate doses of aspi-\\nrin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs, leading to hypo-glycemia. \\nUricosuric Agents (Probenecid and \\nSulfinpyrazone): Salicylates antagonize the \\nuricosuric action of uricosuric agents. \\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of \\nFertility: Administration of aspirin for 68 \\nweeks at 0.5 percent in the feed of rats was not carcinogenic. In the Ames Salmonella assay, aspirin was not mutagenic; however, aspirin did induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Aspirin inhib-its ovulation in rats. (See Pregnancy. ) \\nPregnancy: Pregnant women should only \\ntake aspirin if clearly needed. Because of the known effects of NSAID’s on the fetal cardio-vascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), use during the third trimester of pregnancy should be avoided. Salicylate products have also been associated with al-terations in maternal and neonatal hemo-stasis mechanisms, decreased birth weight, and with perinatal mortality. \\nLabor and Delivery: Aspirin should be \\navoided 1 week prior to and during labor and delivery because it can result in excessive \\nblood loss at delivery. Prolonged gestation and prolonged labor due to prostaglandin in-hibition have been reported. \\nNursing Mothers: Nursing mothers should \\navoid using aspirin because salicylate is ex-creted in breast milk. Use of high doses may lead to rashes, platelet abnormalities, and bleeding in nursing infants. \\nPediatric Use: Pediatric dosing rec-\\nommendations for juvenile rheumatoid ar-thritis are based on well-controlled clinical studies. An initial dose of 90–130 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with an increase as needed for anti-inflammatory efficacy (target plas-ma salicylate levels of 150–300 μg/mL) are ef-\\nfective. At high doses ( i.e., plasma levels of \\ngreater than 200 μg/mL), the incidence of tox-\\nicity increases. \\nADVERSE REACTIONS \\nMany adverse reactions due to aspirin in-\\ngestion are dose-related. The following is a list of adverse reactions that have been re-ported in the literature. (See W\\nARNINGS .) \\nBody as a Whole : Fever, hypothermia, \\nthirst. \\nCardiovascular: Dysrhythmias, hypo-\\ntension, tachycardia. \\nCentral Nervous System: Agitation, cerebral \\nedema, coma, confusion, dizziness, headache, subdural or intracranial hemorrhage, leth-argy, seizures. \\nFluid and Electrolyte: Dehydration, hyper-\\nkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis. \\nGastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, GI bleeding, ul-\\nceration and perforation, nausea, vomiting, transient elevations of hepatic enzymes, hep-atitis, Reye’s Syndrome, pancreatitis. \\nHematologic: Prolongation of the pro-\\nthrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia. \\nHypersensitivity: Acute anaphylaxis, \\nangioedema, asthma, bronchospasm, laryn-geal edema, urticaria. \\nMusculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis. \\nMetabolism: Hypoglycemia (in children), \\nhyperglycemia. \\nReproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and \\nlabor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding. \\nRespiratory: Hyperpnea, pulmonary edema, \\ntachypnea. \\nSpecial Senses: Hearing loss, tinnitus. Pa-\\ntients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clin-ical indicator of salicylism. \\nUrogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary \\nnecrosis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and failure. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00299 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '285', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

There is no known \\npotential for addiction associated with the use of aspirin. \\nOVERDOSAGE \\nSalicylate toxicity may result from acute \\ningestion (overdose) or chronic intoxication. The early signs of salicylic overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations ap-proaching 200 μg/mL. Plasma concentrations \\nof aspirin above 300 μg/mL are clearly toxic. \\nSevere toxic effects are associated with lev-els above 400 μg/mL. (See C\\nLINICAL PHARMA -\\nCOLOGY .) A single lethal dose of aspirin in \\nadults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g. For real or sus-pected overdose, a Poison Control Center should be contacted immediately. Careful medical management is essential. \\nSigns and Symptoms: In acute overdose, se-\\nvere acid-base and electrolyte disturbances may occur and are complicated by hyperthermia and dehydration. Respiratory alkalosis occurs early while hyperventilation is present, but is quickly followed by metabolic acidosis. \\nTreatment: Treatment consists primarily of \\nsupporting vital functions, increasing salicy-late elimination, and correcting the acid- base disturbance. Gastric emptying and/or lavage is recommended as soon as possible after ingestion, even if the patient has vom-ited spontaneously. After lavage and/or emesis, administration of activated char-coal, as a slurry, is beneficial, if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion. Charcoal adsorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage. \\nSeverity of aspirin intoxication is deter-\\nmined by measuring the blood salicylate level. Acid-base status should be closely fol-lowed with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements. Fluid and electrolyte balance should also be maintained. \\nIn severe cases, hyperthermia and \\nhypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life. Children should be sponged \\nwith tepid water. Replacement fluid should be administered intravenously and aug-mented with correction of acidosis. Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal. Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia. \\nHemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can \\nbe performed to reduce the body drug con-tent. In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life-threatening intoxication, di-alysis is usually required. Exchange trans-fusion may be indicated in infants and young children. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \\nEach dose of aspirin should be taken with \\na full glass of water unless patient is fluid restricted. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic dosages should be individualized. When aspi-rin is used in high doses, the development of tinnitus may be used as a clinical sign of ele-vated plasma salicylate levels except in pa-tients with high frequency hearing loss. \\nIschemic Stroke and TIA: 50–325 mg once a \\nday. Continue therapy indefinitely. \\nSuspected Acute MI: The initial dose of 160– \\n162.5 mg is administered as soon as an MI is suspected. The maintenance dose of 160–162.5 mg a day is continued for 30 days post-infarc-tion. After 30 days, consider further therapy based on dosage and administration for pre-vention of recurrent MI. \\nPrevention of Recurrent MI: 75–325 mg once \\na day. Continue therapy indefinitely. \\nUnstable Angina Pectoris: 75–325 mg once a \\nday. Continue therapy indefinitely. \\nChronic Stable Angina Pectoris: 75–325 mg \\nonce a day. Continue therapy indefinitely. \\nCABG: 325 mg daily starting 6 hours post- \\nprocedure. Continue therapy for 1 year post- procedure. \\nPTCA: The initial dose of 325 mg should be \\ngiven 2 hours pre-surgery. Maintenance dose is 160–325 mg daily.

A standard \\nsunscreen shall be used concomitantly in the testing procedures for deter-mining the SPF value of a sunscreen \\ndrug product to ensure the uniform evaluation of sunscreen drug products. The standard sunscreen shall be an 8- percent homosalate preparation with a mean SPF value of 4.47 (standard devi-ation = 1.279). In order for the SPF de-termination of a test product to be considered valid, the SPF of the stand-ard sunscreen must fall within the standard deviation range of the ex-pected SPF ( i.e., 4.47 ±1.279) and the 95- \\npercent confidence interval for the mean SPF must contain the value 4. \\n(b) Preparation of the standard \\nhomosalate sunscreen. (1) The standard \\nhomosalate sunscreen is prepared from two different preparations (preparation A and preparation B) with the fol-lowing compositions: \\nC\\nOMPOSITION OF PREPARATION A AND \\nPREPARATION B OF THE STANDARD SUNSCREEN  \\nIngredients Percent by weight \\nPreparation A \\nLanolin ................................ 5.00 \\nHomosalate ........................ 8.00 \\nWhite petrolatum ................ 2.50 \\nStearic acid ........................ 4.00 \\nPropylparaben .................... 0.05 \\nPreparation B \\nMethylparaben ................... 0.10 \\nEdetate disodium ............... 0.05 \\nPropylene glycol ................. 5.00 \\nTriethanolamine ................. 1.00 \\nPurified water U.S.P .......... 74.30 \\n(2) Preparation A and preparation B \\nare heated separately to 77 to 82 °C, \\nwith constant stirring, until the con-tents of each part are solubilized.

Add suffi-\\ncient purified water to obtain 100 grams of standard sunscreen prepara-tion. \\n(c) Assay of the standard homosalate \\nsunscreen. Assay the standard \\nhomosalate sunscreen preparation by the following method to ensure proper concentration: \\n(1) Preparation of the assay solvent. \\nThe solvent consists of 1 percent gla-cial acetic acid (V/V) in denatured eth-anol. The denatured ethanol should not contain a UV radiation absorbing dena-turant. \\n(2) Preparation of a 1-percent solution \\nof the standard homosalate sunscreen \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00332 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '318', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Accurately weigh 1 gram of \\nthe standard homosalate sunscreen preparation into a 100-milliliter volu-metric flask. Add 50 milliliters of the assay solvent. Heat on a steam bath and mix well. Cool the solution to room temperature (15 to 30 °C). Then \\ndilute the solution to volume with the assay solvent and mix well to make a 1-percent solution. \\n(3) Preparation of the test solution (1:50 \\ndilution of the 1-percent solution). Filter \\na portion of the 1-percent solution through number 1 filter paper. Discard the first 10 to 15 milliliters of the fil-trate. Collect the next 20 milliliters of the filtrate (second collection). Add 1 milliliter of the second collection of the filtrate to a 50-milliliter volu-metric flask. Dilute this solution to volume with assay solvent and mix well. This is the test solution (1:50 dilu-tion of the 1-percent solution). \\n(4) Spectrophotometric determination. \\nThe absorbance of the test solution is measured in a suitable double beam spectrophotometer with the assay sol-vent and reference beam at a wave-length near 306 nanometers. \\n(5) Calculation of the concentration of \\nhomosalate. The concentration of \\nhomosalate is determined by the fol-lowing formula which takes into con-sideration the absorbance of the sam-ple of the test solution, the dilution of the 1-percent solution (1:50), the weight of the sample of the standard homosalate sunscreen preparation (1 gram), and the standard absorbance value (172) of homosalate as deter-mined by averaging the absorbance of a large number of batches of raw \\nhomosalate: \\nConcentration of homosalate = absorb-\\nance × 50 × 100 × 172 = percent con-\\ncentration by weight. \\n§ 352.71 Light source (solar simulator). \\nA solar simulator used for deter-\\nmining the SPF of a sunscreen drug product should be filtered so that it provides a continuous emission spec-trum from 290 to 400 nanometers simi-lar to sunlight at sea level from the sun at a zenith angle of 10 ° it has less \\nthan 1 percent of its total energy out-put contributed by nonsolar wave-lengths shorter than 290 nanometers; and it has not more than 5 percent of its total energy output contributed by \\nwavelengths longer than 400 nano-meters. In addition, a solar simulator should have no significant time-related fluctuations in radiation emissions after an appropriate warmup time, and it should have good beam uniformity (within 10 percent) in the exposure plane. To ensure that the solar simu-lator delivers the appropriate spectrum of UV radiation, it must be measured periodically with an accurately-cali-brated spectroradiometer system or equivalent instrument. \\n§ 352.72 General testing procedures. \\n(a) Selection of test subjects (male and \\nfemale). (1) Only fair-skin subjects with \\nskin types I, II, and III using the fol-lowing guidelines shall be selected: \\nSelection of Fair-skin Subjects \\nSkin Type and Sunburn and Tanning History \\n(Based on first 30 to 45 minutes sun exposure after a winter season of no sun exposure.) \\nI—Always burns easily; never tans (sen-\\nsitive). \\nII—Always burns easily; tans minimally \\n(sensitive). \\nIII—Burns moderately; tans gradually (light \\nbrown) (normal). \\nIV—Burns minimally; always tans well \\n(moderate brown) (normal). \\nV—Rarely burns; tans profusely (dark \\nbrown) (insensitive). \\nVI—Never burns; deeply pigmented (insensi-\\ntive). \\n(2) A medical history shall be ob-\\ntained from all subjects with emphasis on the effects of sunlight on their skin. Ascertain the general health of the in-dividual, the individual’s skin type (I, II, or III), whether the individual is taking medication (topical or sys-temic) that is known to produce abnor-mal sunlight responses, and whether the individual is subject to any abnor-mal responses to sunlight, such as a phototoxic or photoallergic response. \\n(b) Test site inspection. The physical \\nexamination shall determine the pres-ence of sunburn, suntan, scars, active dermal lesions, and uneven skin tones on the areas of the back to be tested. The presence of nevi, blemishes, or moles will be acceptable if in the phy-sician’s judgment they will not inter-fere with the study results. Excess hair on the back is acceptable if the hair is clipped or shaved. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00333 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '319', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Legally effective \\nwritten informed consent must be ob-tained from all individuals. \\n(d) Test site delineation —(1) Test site \\narea. A test site area serves as an area \\nfor determining the subject’s MED after application of either the sun-screen standard or the test sunscreen product, or for determining the sub-ject’s MED when the skin is unpro-tected (control site). The area to be tested shall be the back between the beltline and the shoulder blade (scapulae) and lateral to the midline. Each test site area for applying a prod-uct or the standard sunscreen shall be a minimum of 50-square centimeters, e.g., 5 × 10 centimeters. The test site \\nareas are outlined with ink. If the per-son is to be tested in an upright posi-tion, the lines shall be drawn on the skin with the subject upright. If the subject is to be tested while prone, the markings shall be made with the sub-ject prone. \\n(2) Test subsite area. Each test site \\narea shall be divided into at least three test subsite areas that are at least 1 square centimeter. Usually four or five subsites are employed. Each test subsite within a test site area is sub-jected to a specified dosage of UV radi-ation, in a series of UV radiation expo-sures, in which the test site area is ex-posed for the determination of the MED. \\n(e) Application of test materials. To en-\\nsure standardized reporting and to de-fine a product’s SPF value, the applica-tion of the product shall be expressed on a weight basis per unit area which establishes a standard film. Both the test sunscreen product and the stand-ard sunscreen application shall be 2 milligrams per square centimeter. For oils and most lotions, the viscosity is such that the material can be applied with a volumetric syringe. For creams, heavy gels, and butters, the product shall be warmed slightly so that it can be applied volumetrically. On heating, care shall be taken not to alter the product’s physical characteristics, es-pecially separation of the formula-tions. Pastes and ointments shall be weighed, then applied by spreading on the test site area. A product shall be spread by using a finger cot. If two or more sunscreen drug products are being evaluated at the same time, the \\ntest products and the standard sun-screen, as specified in §352.70, should be applied in a blinded, randomized man-ner. If only one sunscreen drug product is being tested, the testing subsites should be exposed to the varying doses of UV radiation in a randomized man-ner. \\n(f) Waiting period. Before exposing the \\ntest site areas after applying a product, a waiting period of at least 15 minutes is required. \\n(g) Number of subjects. A test panel \\nshall consist of not more than 25 sub-\\njects with the number fixed in advance by the investigator. From this panel, at least 20 subjects must produce valid data for analysis. \\n(h) Response criteria. In order that the \\nperson who evaluates the MED re-sponses does not know which sunscreen formulation was applied to which site or what doses of UV radiation were ad-ministered, he/she must not be the same person who applied the sunscreen drug product to the test site or admin-istered the doses of UV radiation. After UV radiation exposure from the solar simulator is completed, all immediate responses shall be recorded. These in-clude several types of typical responses such as the following: An immediate darkening or tanning, typically greyish or purplish in color, fading in 30 to 60 minutes, and attributed to photo-oxi-dation of existing melanin granules; immediate reddening, fading rapidly, and viewed as a normal response of capillaries and venules to heat, visible and infrared radiation; and an imme-diate generalized heat response, resem-bling prickly heat rash, fading in 30 to 60 minutes, and apparently caused by heat and moisture generally irritating to the skin’s surface. After the imme-diate responses are noted, each subject shall shield the exposed area from fur-ther UV radiation for the remainder of the test day. The MED is determined 22 to 24 hours after exposure. The ery-thema responses of the test subject should be evaluated under the fol-lowing conditions: The source of illu-mination should be either a tungsten light bulb or a warm white fluorescent light bulb that provides a level of illu-mination at the test site within the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00334 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '320', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Testing depends upon determining the smallest dose of energy that produces redness reaching the borders of the ex-posure site at 22 to 24 hours postexposure for each series of expo-sures. To determine the MED, some-what more intense erythemas must also be produced. The goal is to have some exposures that produce abso-lutely no effect, and of those exposures that produce an effect, the maximal ex-posure should be no more than twice the total energy of the minimal expo-sure. \\n(i) Rejection of test data. Test data \\nshall be rejected if the exposure series fails to elicit an MED response on ei-\\nther the treated or unprotected skin sites, or if the responses on the treated sites are randomly absent (which indi-cates the product was not spread even-ly), or if the subject was noncompliant \\n(e.g., subject withdraws from the test due to illness or work conflicts, subject does not shield the exposed testing sites from further UV radiation until the MED is read, etc.). \\n§ 352.73 Determination of SPF value. \\n(a)(1) The following erythema action \\nspectrum shall be used to calculate the erythema effective exposure of a solar simulator: \\nV\\ni(λ) = 1.0 (250 < λ <298 nm) \\nVi(λ) = 1.00.094 (298 - λ)(298 < λ <328 nano-\\nmeters) \\nVi(λ) = 1.00.015 (139 - λ)(328 < λ <400 nano-\\nmeters) \\n(2) The data contained in this action \\nspectrum are to be used as spectral weighting factors to calculate the ery-thema effective exposure of a solar simulator as follows: \\n(b) Determination of MED of the unpro-\\ntected skin. A series of UV radiation ex-\\nposures expressed as Joules per square meter (adjusted to the erythema action spectrum calculated according to §352.73(a)) is administered to the subsite areas on each subject with an accurately calibrated solar simulator. A series of five exposures shall be ad-ministered to the untreated, unpro-tected skin to determine the subject’s \\ninherent MED. The doses selected shall be a geometric series represented by (1.25\\nn), wherein each exposure time in-\\nterval is 25 percent greater than the previous time to maintain the same relative uncertainty (expressed as a constant percentage), independent of the subject’s sensitivity to UV radi-ation, regardless of whether the subject \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 11:50 Oct 13, 2021 Jkt 253075 PO 00000 Frm 00335 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\253075.XXX 253075\\nER21MY99.000</GPH>spaschal on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with CFR' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol5-chapI-subchapD.pdf', 'page': '321', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

This MED(US) shall be used in the determination of the series of UV radiation exposures to be administered to the protected site in subsequent testing. The MED(US) should be deter-mined again on the same day as the standard and test sunscreens and this MED(US) should be used in calculating the SPF. \\n(c) Determination of individual SPF \\nvalues. A series of UV radiation expo-\\nsures expressed as Joules per square meter (adjusted to the erythema action spectrum calculated according to §352.73(a)) is administered to the subsite areas on each subject with an accurately-calibrated solar simulator. A series of seven exposures shall be ad-ministered to the protected test sites to determine the MED of the protected skin (MED(PS)). The doses selected shall consist of a geometric series of five exposures, where the middle expo-sure is placed to yield the expected SPF plus two other exposures placed symmetrically around the middle expo-sure. The exact series of exposures to be given to the protected skin shall be determined by the previously estab-lished MED(US) and the expected SPF of the test sunscreen. For products with an expected SPF less than 8, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.64X, 0.80X, 0.90X, 1.00X, 1.10X, 1.25X, and 1.56X, where X equals the expected SPF of the test product. For products with an expected SPF between 8 and 15, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.69X, 0.83X, 0.91X, 1.00X, 1.09X, 1.20X, and 1.44X, where X equals the ex-pected SPF of the test product. For products with an expected SPF greater that 15, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.76X, 0.87X, 0.93X, 1.00X, 1.07X, 1.15X, and 1.32X, where X equals the expected SPF of the test product. The MED is the quantity of erythema-effective energy required to produce the first perceptible, unambig-uous redness reaction with clearly de-fined borders at 22 to 24 hours postexposure. The SPF value of the test sunscreen is then calculated from the dose of UV radiation required to produce the MED of the protected skin and from the dose of UV radiation re-quired to produce the MED of the un-\\nprotected skin (control site) as follows: \\nSPF value = the ratio of erythema ef-\\nfective exposure (Joules per square meter) (MED(PS)) to the erythema ef-fective exposure (Joules per square meter) (MED(US)). \\n(d) Determination of the test product’s \\nSPF value and PCD. Use data from at \\nleast 20 test subjects with n rep-resenting the number of subjects used. First, for each subject, compute the SPF value as stated in §352.73(b) and (c). Second, compute the mean SPF value, x ¯, and the standard deviation, s, \\nfor these subjects. Third, obtain the upper 5-percent point from the t dis-tribution table with n-1 degrees of free-dom. Denote this value by t. Fourth, compute ts/ √n. Denote this quantity \\nby A ( i.e., A = ts/ √n). Fifth, calculate \\nthe SPF value to be used in labeling as follows: the label SPF equals the larg-est whole number less than x ¯. - A. \\nSixth and last, the drug product is classified into a PCD as follows: if 30 + A <x¯, the PCD is High; if 12 + A <x ¯<30 \\n+ A, the PCD is Moderate; if 2 + A <x ¯ \\n<12 + A, the PCD is Minimal; if x ¯<2 + \\nA, the product shall not be labeled as a sunscreen drug product and shall not display an SPF value. \\n§ 352.76 Determination if a product is \\nwater resistant or very water resist-ant. \\nThe general testing procedures in \\n§352.72 shall be used as part of the fol-lowing tests, except where modified in this section.

A Radioactive Drug \\nResearch Committee, composed and ap-proved by the Food and Drug Adminis-tration in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, has determined, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, that: \\n(i) The pharmacological dose is with-\\nin the limits set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; \\n(ii) The radiation dose is within the \\nlimits set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; \\n(iii) The radiation exposure is justi-\\nfied by the quality of the study being undertaken and the importance of the information it seeks to obtain; \\n(iv) The study meets the other re-\\nquirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section regarding qualifications of the investigator, proper licensure for handling radioactive materials, selec-tion and consent of research subjects, quality of radioactive drugs used, re-search protocol design, reporting of ad-\\nverse reactions, and approval by an ap-propriate Institutional Review Com-mittee; and \\n(v) The use of the radioactive drug in \\nhuman subjects has the approval of the Radioactive Drug Research Committee. \\n(2) Limit on pharmacological dose. The \\namount of active ingredient or com-bination of active ingredients to be ad-ministered shall be known not to cause any clinically detectable pharma-cological effect in human beings. If the same active ingredients (exclusive of the radionuclide) are to be adminis-tered simultaneously, e.g., under a ‘‘Investigational New Drug Applica-tion’’ or for a therapeutic use in ac-cordance with labeling for a drug ap-proved under part 314 of this chapter, the total amount of active ingredients including the radionuclide shall be known not to exceed the dose limita-tions applicable to the separate admin-istration of the active ingredients ex-cluding the radionuclide. (3) Limit on radiation dose. The \\namount of radioactive material to be administered shall be such that the subject receives the smallest radiation dose with which it is practical to per-\\nform the study without jeopardizing the benefits to be obtained from the study. \\n(i) Under no circumstances may the \\nradiation dose to an adult research subject from a single study or cumula-tively from a number of studies con-ducted within 1 year be generally rec-ognized as safe if such dose exceeds the following: \\nWhole body, active blood-forming or-\\ngans, lens of the eye, and gonads: \\nRems \\nSingle dose ....................................................... 3 \\nAnnual and total dose commitment ................. 5 \\nOther organs: \\nSingle dose ....................................................... 5 \\nAnnual and total dose commitment ................. 15 \\n(ii) For a research subject under 18 \\nyears of age at his last birthday, the radiation dose shall not exceed 10 per-cent of that set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. \\n(iii) All radioactive material included \\nin the drug either as essential material or as a significant contaminant or im-purity shall be included when deter-mining the total radiation doses and dose commitments. Radiation doses from x-ray procedures that are part of the research study ( i.e., would not have \\noccurred but for the study) shall also be included. The possibility of followup studies shall be considered for inclu-sion in the dose calculations. \\n(iv) Numerical definitions of dose \\nshall be based on an absorbed fraction method of radiation absorbed dose cal-culation, such as the system set forth by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine, or the system set forth by the International Commission on Radi-ological Protection. \\n(c) A Radioactive Drug Research \\nCommittee, in order to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall be composed, shall function, and shall ob-tain and maintain approval of the Food and Drug Administration in con-formity with the following: \\n(1) Membership.

The remainder of the committee shall consist of individuals qualified in various disciplines perti-nent to the field of nuclear medicine (e.g., radiology, internal medicine, clinical pathology, hematology, endo-crinology, radiation therapy, radiation physics, radiation biophysics, health physics, and radiopharmacy). Member-ship shall be sufficiently diverse to per-mit expert review of the technical and scientific aspects of proposals sub-mitted to the committee. The addition of consultants in other pertinent med-ical disciplines is encouraged. A Radio-active Drug Research Committee shall be either associated with a medical in-stitution operated for care of patients and with sufficient scientific expertise to allow for selection of committee members from its faculty, or with a committee established by a State au-thority to provide advice on radiation health matters. Joint committees in-volving more than one medical institu-tion which have been established in order to achieve a high level and diver-sity of experience will be acceptable. The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research may modify any of the foregoing requirements in a particular situation where alternative factors provide substantially the same composition and association. \\n(2) Function. Each Radioactive Drug \\nResearch Committee shall select a chairman, who shall sign all applica-tions, minutes, and reports of the com-mittee. Each committee shall meet at least once each quarter in which re-search activity has been authorized or conducted. A quorum consisting of more than 50 percent of the member-ship must be present with appropriate representation of the required fields of specialization. Minutes shall be kept and shall include the numerical results of votes on protocols involving use in human subjects. No member shall vote on a protocol in which he is an investi-gator. (3) Reports.

Ap-proval shall be based upon an assess-ment of the qualifications of the mem-bers of the committee, and the assur-ance that all necessary fields of exper-tise are covered. Approval of a com-mittee may be withdrawn at any time for failure of the committee to comply with any of the requirements of this section. Approval of a committee shall remain effective unless and until the FDA withdraws such approval. Changes in membership and applications for new members shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration as soon as, or before, vacancies occur on the committee. (5) Monitoring. The Food and Drug \\nAdministration shall conduct periodic reviews of approved committees. Moni-toring of the activities of the com-mittee shall be conducted through re-view of its annual report, through re-view of minutes and full protocols for certain studies, and through on-site in-spections. \\n(d) In making the determination re-\\nquired in paragraph (b)(1) of this sec-tion, a Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall consider the following requirements and assure that each is met: \\n(1) Radiation dose to subjects. To as-\\nsure that the radiation dose to re-search subjects is as low as practicable to perform the study and meet the cri-teria of §361.1(b)(3), the Radioactive Drug Research Committee shall require that: \\n(i) The investigator provide absorbed \\ndose calculations based on biologic dis-tribution data available from published literature or from other valid studies. \\n(ii) The investigator provide for an \\nacceptable method of radioassay of the radioactive drug prior to its use to as-sure that the dose calculations actu-ally reflect the administered dose. \\n(iii) The radioactive drug chosen for \\nthe study has that combination of half- life, types of radiations, radiation en-ergy, metabolism, chemical properties, etc., which results in the lowest dose to the whole body or specific organs with which it is possible to obtain the nec-essary information. \\n(iv) The investigator utilize adequate \\nand appropriate instrumentation for the detection and measurement of the specific radionuclide. \\n(2) Pharmacological dosage. To deter-\\nmine that the amount of active ingre-dients to be administered does not ex-ceed the limitations set forth in para-graph (b)(2) of this section, the com-mittee shall require that the investi-gator provide pharmacological dose calculations based on data available from published literature or from other valid human studies. \\n(3) Qualifications of investigators.

Each in-\\nvestigator shall select appropriate human subjects and shall obtain the re-view and approval of an institutional review committee that conforms to the requirements of part 56 of this chapter, and shall obtain the consent of the sub-jects or their legal representatives in accordance with part 50 of this chapter. The research subjects shall be at least 18 years of age and legally competent. Exceptions are permitted only in those special situations when it can be dem-onstrated to the committee that the study presents a unique opportunity to gain information not currently avail-able, requires the use of research sub-jects less than 18 years of age, and is without significant risk to the subject. Studies involving minors shall be sup-ported with review by qualified pedi-atric consultants to the Radioactive Drug Research Committee. Each fe-male research subject of childbearing potential shall state in writing that she is not pregnant, or, on the basis of a pregnancy test be confirmed as not pregnant, before she may participate in any study. \\n(6) Quality of radioactive drug. The ra-\\ndioactive drug used in the research study shall meet appropriate chemical, pharmaceutical, radiochemical, and radionuclidic standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity as needed for safety and be of such uniform and reproducible quality as to give signifi-cance to the research study conducted. The Radioactive Drug Research Com-mittee shall determine that radio-active materials for parenteral use are prepared in sterile and pyrogen-free form. \\n(7) Research protocol. No matter how \\nsmall the amount of radioactivity, no study involving administration of a ra-dioactive drug, as defined in §310.3(n) of this chapter, to research subjects under \\nthis section, shall be permitted unless the Radioactive Drug Research Com-mittee concludes, in its judgment, that scientific knowledge and benefit is likely to result from that study. There-fore, the protocol shall be based upon a sound rationale derived from appro-priate animal studies or published lit-erature and shall be of sound design such that information of scientific value may result. The radiation dose shall be both sufficient and no greater than necessary to obtain valid meas-urement. The projected number of sub-jects shall be sufficient but no greater than necessary for the purpose of the study. The number of subjects shall also reflect the fact that the study is intended to obtain basic research infor-mation referred to in paragraph (a) of this section and not intended for imme-diate therapeutic, diagnostic or similar purposes or to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug in humans for such purposes ( i.e., to carry out a \\nclinical trial). \\n(8) Adverse reactions. The investigator \\nshall immediately report to the Radio-active Drug Research Committee all adverse effects associated with the use of the radioactive drug in the research study. All adverse reactions probably attributable to the use of the radio-active drug in the research study shall be immediately reported by the Radio-active Drug Research Committee to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search, HFD–160, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. \\n(9) Approval by an institutional review \\nboard.
