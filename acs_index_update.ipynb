BACKGROUND \\n53  \\n                                                 \\n4  Bioequivalence  is a statutory term reflected in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) in section \\n505(j)  (21 U.S.C. 355(j)), which requires ANDA applicants  to demonstrate, among other things, that the  proposed  \\ngeneric product is bioequivalent to its reference listed dr ug.  Section 505(j)(2)(A)(iv)  of the FD&C Act; see also \\nsection 50  5(j)(8) of the FD&C  Act.  There is no similar statutory requ irement for an  NDA applicant either under \\nsection 505(b)(1) or  (b)(2) of the FD&C Act to  demonstrate bioequivalence of its proposed  product to another \\nproduct.  As a scientific matter, however, the same or a similar showing  of  the bioavailability of two  products in the \\nNDA context  may be needed for the purposes of evaluating the safety  or  effectiveness of a product.  For ease of the  \\nreader, we refer to such evaluations  of the relative bioavailability for two or more products as an evaluation of \\nbioequivalence in this guidance.  \\n \\n5 For information on these types of studies,  see FDA’s Drugs guidance Web page.

      "page_content=' \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\n \\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n \\n54 BA assessment of formulations is a component of new drug development.  The approaches of \\n55 evaluating BA and BE discussed in this guida nce are designed to aid FDA evaluation of the \\n56 safety and effectiveness of a product that is th e subject of an IND, NDA, or NDA supplement.  \\n57 In this endeavor, we use the totality of inform ation available in the submission, which includes, \\n58 among other things, information gathered usi ng the principles of BE, exposure-response \\n59 evaluations, and clinical trial re sults.  The evaluation of BE in the generic drug context, by \\n60 contrast, is used to support a determination that a generic product may be substituted for its \\n61 reference listed drug, and involves consideration  of different types of data permitted in an \\n62 ANDA. Accordingly, the approaches discusse d in this guidance may differ from similar \\n63 discussions of BE in the ANDA BE Draft Guidan ce.  For example, this NDA BA and BE Draft \\n64 Guidance recommends assessment of the effect of food on BA using the approaches set forth in \\n65 FDA’s 2002 guidance for industry on Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence \\n66 Studies (the 2002 Food-Effect Guidance).  Fasting BE studies generally  are sufficient, given the \\n67 totality of information we consider in ev aluating INDs, NDAs, or NDA supplements.  In \\n68 contrast, we recommend in the ANDA BE Draft Guidance fed and fasting BE studies that will \\n69 provide specific information to support a demonstration of BE under sec tion 505(j) of the FD&C \\n70 Act, and in turn, to support substitutability. Even though the ANDA BE Draft Guidance revises \\n71 and replaces the parts of the 2002 Food-Eff ect Guidance pertaining to ANDAs and ANDA \\n72 supplements, this NDA BA and BE Draft Gu idance does not replace the 2002 Food-Effect \\n73 Guidance relating to studies for INDs, NDAs, and NDA supplements.8    \\n74  \\n75 A.  General \\n76  \\n77 Studies to measure BA and/or establish BE of  a product are important elements in support of \\n78 INDs, NDAs, and NDA supplements.  Bioavailability  means the rate and extent to which the \\n79 active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed  from a drug product and becomes available at the \\n80 site of action (21 CFR 320.1(a)). BA data pr ovide an estimate of the fraction of the drug \\n81 absorbed, as well as provide information relate d to the pharmacokinetics of the drug.     \\n82  \\n83 Bioequivalence means the absence of a significant differe nce in the rate and extent to which the \\n84 active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceuti cal equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives \\n85 become available at the site of drug action wh en administered at the same molar dose under \\n86 similar conditions in an appropr iately designed study (21 CFR  320.1( e)).  Studies to establish \\n87 BE between two products are important for cer tain formulation or manufacturing changes \\n88 occurring during the drug development and posta pproval stages.  In BE studies, the exposure \\n89 profile of a test drug product is compar ed to that of a re ference drug product. \\n90  \\n91 B.  Bioavailability \\n92  \\n93 BA for a given formulation provides an estim ate of the relative fraction of the orally \\n94 administered dose that is absorbed into the system ic circulation.  BA for orally administered drug \\n95 products can be documented by comparing a system ic exposure profile to that of a suitable \\n96 reference product. A profile can be generate d by measuring the concentration of active \\n                                                 \\n8 Accordingly, we are in the process of revising the 2002 Food-Effect Guidance.  \\n3\\n\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '6', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Systemic exposure profiles reflect both \\n99 release of the drug substance from the drug product  and a series of possibl e presystemic/systemic \\n100 actions on the drug substance after its  release from the drug product.   \\n101  \\n102 FDA’s regulations at 21 CFR 320.25 set forth guidelines for in vivo BA studies.  As provided in \\n103 this regulation, the reference product for BA st udies should be a solution, suspension, or \\n104 intravenous (IV) dosage form (21 CFR 320.25(d)(2 ) and (3)).  The purpose of conducting a BA \\n105 study with an oral solution as a reference is  to assess the impact of formulation on BA. \\n106 Conducting a BA study with an IV reference enables assessment of the impact of route of \\n107 administration on BA and defines the absolute BA of the drug released from the drug product. \\n108    \\n109  \\n110 C.  Bioequivalence \\n111  \\n112 As noted previously, both BA and BE focus on the release of a drug substance from a drug \\n113 product and subsequent absorption into systemic circulation.  As a resu lt, we recommend that \\n114 approaches to determining BE generally follow approaches similar to those used for BA.  \\n115 Demonstrating BE involves a more formal comparat ive test that uses spec ific references with \\n116 specified criteria for comparisons and pr edetermined BE limits for such criteria.  \\n117   \\n118 1.  Preapproval Changes \\n119  \\n120 BE documentation can be useful during the IND period to compare (1) early and late \\n121 clinical trial formulations; (2) formulations used  in clinical trials a nd stability studies, if \\n122 different; (3) clinical trial formulations a nd to-be-marketed drug products, if different; \\n123 and (4) product strength equi valence, as appropriate.  In each comparison, the new \\n124 formulation, formulation produced by the ne w method of manufacture, or new strength is \\n125 the candidate, or test product and the prior formulation, prior met hod of manufacture, or \\n126 prior strength is the reference product.  The decision to document BE during drug \\n127 development is generally left to the judgme nt of the sponsor, using the principles of \\n128 relevant guidances (in this guidance, see sections II.C.2, Postapproval Changes, and \\n129 III.D, In Vitro Studies) to determine when changes in components, composition, and/or \\n130 method of manufacture suggest that further in vitro and/or in vivo studies be performed. \\n131  \\n132 2.  Postapproval Changes \\n133  \\n134 In the presence of certain ma jor changes in components, co mposition, manufacturing site, \\n135 and/or method of manufacture after approval, FDA recomme nds that in vivo BE be \\n136 demonstrated for the drug product after the change in comparison to the drug product \\n137 before the change. Under section 506A(c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \\n138 Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 356a(c)(2)), certain postapproval ch anges that require \\n139 completion of studies must be submitted in a supplement and approved by FDA before \\n140 distributing a drug product made with the change. \\n141  \\n4\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '7', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content=' \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n142 Information on the types of recommended in vi tro dissolution and in vivo BE studies for \\n143 immediate-release and modified-release dr ug products approved as NDAs for specified \\n144 postapproval changes is provided in the following FDA guidances : \\n145 \\n146 \\uf0b7 SUPAC-IR: Immediate Release Solid Or al Dosage Forms:  Scale-Up and \\n147 Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control; In Vitro \\n148 Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo  Bioequivalence Documentation \\n149 \\uf0b7 SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral  Dosage Forms:  Scale-Up and \\n150 Postapproval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, In Vitro \\n151 Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo  Bioequivalence Documentation \\n152 \\n153 3. BE Considerations \\n154 \\n155 BE studies are usually conducted using a cross over design.  For such studies, intrasubject \\n156 variability should be considered  when determining the study sample size.  In cases when \\n157 a parallel design is necessary to evaluate BE, consideration shoul d be given to total \\n158 variability, including intersubject variability in stead of just intrasub ject variability.   \\n159 160 A test product might fail to demonstrate bioequivalence because it ha s measures of rate \\n161 and/or extent of absorption compared to th e reference product outside acceptable higher \\n162 or lower limits. For example, when the test product results in a syst emic exposure that is \\n163 significantly higher than that of  the reference product, the concern is the typically limited \\n164 experience from a safety standpoint for higher systemic concentrations.  When the test \\n165 product has a systemic exposure that is signif icantly lower than that of the reference \\n166 product, the concern is potentially a lack of therapeutic efficacy of the test product.  \\n167 When the variability of the test product is gr eater than the reference product, the concern \\n168 relates to both safety and efficacy, because it may suggest that the performance of the test \\n169 product is not comparable to the referen ce product, and the test product may be too \\n170 variable to be c linically useful. \\n171 \\n172 When BE is not demonstrated, the sponsor shoul d demonstrate that the differences in rate \\n173 and extent of absorption do not significantl y affect the safety and efficacy based on \\n174 available dose-response or concen tration-response data.  In th e absence of this evidence, \\n175 failure to demonstrate BE may suggest that the test product should be reformulated, or \\n176 the method of manufacture for the test product should be changed, or additional safety or \\n177 efficacy data may be needed for the test product.  In some cases, conclusions of BE based \\n178 on the peak drug concentration (C\\nmax) and area under the plasma concentration time curve \\n179 (AUC) between the test product and the reference product may be insufficient to \\n180 demonstrate that there is no difference in safe ty or efficacy if the systemic concentration\\xad\\n181 time profiles of the test product and the refere nce product are different (e.g., time to reach \\n182 peak drug concentration (T max) is different). For example, differences in the shape of the \\n183 systemic concentration profile between the te st and reference produc ts could imply that \\n184 the test product may not produce the same clin ical response as the reference product.  In \\n185 such cases, additional data analysis (e.g., partial AUCs), exposure-re sponse evaluation, or \\n186 clinical studies may be recommended to evaluate the BE of  the two products. \\n5\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '8', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content=' \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\n \\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n \\n187  \\n188 III.    METHODS TO DOCUMENT BA AND BE \\n189  \\n190 Under FDA’s regulations, applicants must use the most accurate, sensitive, and reproducible \\n191 method available to demonstrate BA or BE of  a product (21 CFR 320.24(a)).  As noted in 21 \\n192 CFR 320.24, several in vivo and in vitro methods can  be used to measure BA and to establish \\n193 BE. These include, in general order of preferen ce, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, in vitro tests \\n194 predictive of human in vivo BA (in vitro-in vivo correlation), pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, \\n195 studies with clinical benefit endpoi nts, and other in vitro studies. In addition, where in vivo data \\n196 are appropriate to demonstrate BA, our regulati ons provide guidelines on specific types of in \\n197 vivo BA studies (see 21 CFR 320.25 through 320.29).  This guidance predominantly focuses on \\n198 the use of PK studies to document BA or BE.   \\n199  \\n200 A.  Pharmacokinetic Studies \\n201  \\n202 1.  General Considerations \\n203  \\n204 FDA’s regulations generally defi ne BA and BE in terms of ra te and extent of absorption \\n205 of the active ingredient or moiety to the site of action.9 For in vivo studies, the \\n206 regulations also provide for use of PK measures  in an accessible biological matrix such as \\n207 blood, plasma, and/or serum to indicate rele ase of the drug substance from the drug \\n208 product into the systemic circulation.10  BA and BE frequently rely on PK measures such  \\n209 as AUC to assess extent of  systemic exposure and C max  and T max to assess rate of systemic \\n210 absorption. PK-based comparisons to describe  relative BA or make BE determinations \\n211 are predicated on an understanding that measur ing the active moiety or ingredient at the \\n212 site of action is generally not possible and on an assumption that some relationship exists \\n213 between the efficacy/safety and concentration of the active moiety and/or its important \\n214 metabolite(s) in the systemic circulation.  A typical study is conducted as a crossover \\n215 study. The crossover design reduces variability caused by patient-specific factors, thereby \\n216 increasing the ability to discern differences because of formulation. \\n217  \\n218 2.  Pilot Study  \\n219  \\n220 If the sponsor chooses, a pilo t study in a small number of  subjects can be carried out \\n221 before proceeding with a full-scale BA or BE study. The pilot study can be used to \\n222 validate analytical methodology, assess PK variability, determine samp le size to achieve \\n223 adequate power, optimize sample collection time intervals, and determine the length of  \\n224 the washout period needed between treatme nts.  For example, for conventional \\n225 immediate-release products, careful timing of initial samples may avoid a subsequent \\n226 finding in a full-scale study that the firs t sample collection occurs after the C max. For  \\n227 modified-release products, a pilo t study can help determine the sampling schedule needed \\n                                                 \\n9 21 CFR 320.1(a) and  (e). \\n10 See, e.g., 21  CFR 320.24(b)(1)(i).  If serial measurements  of the drug  or its metabolites in plasma, serum, or blood  \\ncannot be accomplished, t  hen measurement  of urinary  excretion can be used.   \\n6\\n\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '9', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content=' \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\n \\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n \\n228 to assess lag time and dose dumping.  The result s of a pilot study can be used as the sole \\n229 basis to document BA or BE provided the st udy’s design and execution are suitable and a \\n230 sufficient number of subject s have completed the study. \\n231  \\n232 3.  Full-Scale Study \\n233  \\n234 General recommendations for a standard BA or BE study based on PK measurements are \\n235 provided in Appendix A. Nonreplicate cro ssover study designs are recommended for BA \\n236 and BE studies of immediate-release and m odified-release dosage forms.  However, \\n237 sponsors and/or applicants have the option of  using replicate designs for BE studies.  \\n238 Replicate crossover designs are used to allo w estimation of (1) with in-subject variance \\n239 for the reference product, or for both the test  and reference products, and (2) the subject \\n240 by formulation interaction variance com ponent.  This design accounts for the inter\\xad\\n241 occasion variability that may confound the interpretation of a BE study as compared to a \\n242 non-replicate crossover approach. The recomme nded method of analysis for nonreplicate \\n243 or replicate studies to eval uate BE is average BE, as discussed in section IV.  \\n244 Recommendations for conducting and evaluating  replicate study designs can be found in \\n245 the FDA guidance for industry Statistical Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence.  \\n246  \\n247 4.  Study Population \\n248  \\n249 Subjects recruited for BA or BE studies should be 18 years of age or older and capable of \\n250 giving informed consent.  In general, BA a nd BE studies should be  conducted in healthy \\n251 volunteers if the product can be safely admini stered to this population. A study in healthy \\n252 volunteers is likely to produce less PK variabi lity compared with that in patients with \\n253 potentially confounding factors such as unde rlying and/or concomitant disease and \\n254 concomitant medications. Male and female s ubjects should be enrolled in BA and BE \\n255 studies unless there is a specific reason to exclude one sex. Such exclusions could be \\n256 related to the drug product be ing indicated in only one se x or a greater potential for \\n257 adverse reactions in one sex compared to the other.  For example, oral contraceptives are \\n258 evaluated in female subjects because the indica tion is specific to females.  If a drug has  \\n259 the potential to be a teratogen, the drug produc t should be evaluated in male subjects.  \\n260 Female subjects enrolled in th e study should not be pregnant at the beginning of the study \\n261 and should not become pregnant during the study .  In some instances (e.g., when safety \\n262 considerations preclude use of healthy subjects), it may be  necessary to evaluate BA and \\n263 BE in patients for whom the drug product is in tended.  In this situation, sponsors and/or \\n264 applicants should attempt to en roll patients whose disease proce ss is expected to be stable \\n265 for the duration of the study. \\n266  \\n267 5.  Single-Dose and Multiple-Dose (Steady State) Testing \\n268  \\n269 This guidance generally recommends singl e-dose PK studies to assess BA and BE \\n270 because they are generally more sensitive than steady-state studies in assessing rate and \\n271 extent of release of the drug substance from the drug product into the systemic \\n272 circulation.  \\n7\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '10', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

This regulation also iden tifies instances in which multiple-dose BA \\n276 studies may be required: \\n277 \\n278 i. There is a difference in the rate of absorp tion but not in the extent of absorption. \\n279 ii. There is excessive variability in bi oavailability from subject to subject. \\n280 iii. The concentration of the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, or its \\n281 metabolite(s), in the blood resulting from a single dose is too low for accurate \\n282 determination by the analytical method. \\n283 iv. The drug product is an extended-release dosage form.11 \\n284 \\n285 We recommend that if a multiple-dose st udy design is performed, appropriate dosage \\n286 administration and sampling be carried out to  document attainment of steady state. \\n287 288 6. Bioanalytical Methodology \\n289 290 We recommend that sponsors ensure that bi oanalytical methods for BA and BE studies \\n291 be accurate, precise, specific, sensitive, and reproducible.  A separate FDA guidance, \\n292 Bioanalytical Method Validation , is available to assist sponsors in validating \\n293 bioanalytical methods.\\n12 \\n294 \\n295 7. Administration Under Fasted/Fed Conditions \\n296 \\n297 The BA or BE study should be conducted under fa sting conditions (after an overnight fast \\n298 of at least 10 hours) except when tolerability issues are anticipated with fasting.  In these \\n299 cases, we recommend that applicants c onduct only a fed study.  A separate FDA \\n300 guidance, Food-Effect Bioavailability and Fed Bioequivalence Studies  is available to \\n301 assist sponsors. \\n302 303 8. Moieties to Be Measured \\n304 \\n305 The active ingredient that is released from the dosage form or its active moiety and, when \\n306 appropriate, its active metabolites\\n13 should be measured in biol ogical fluids collected in \\n307 BA studies. \\n308 \\n309 Measurement of the active ingredient or the active moiety, rather than metabolites, is \\n310 generally recommended for BE studies because  the concentration-time profile of the \\n311 active ingredient or the active moiety is more sensitive to changes in formulation \\n312 performance than that of the metabolite, whic h is more reflective of metabolite formation, \\n313 distribution, and elimination.  The following are instances when an active metabolite(s) \\n314 should be measured. \\n11 21 CFR 320.27(a)(3). \\n12 See also 21 CFR 320.29. \\n13 See 21 CFR 320.24(b)(1)(i). \\n8\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '11', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In this case, the metabolite  should be measured in lieu of the active \\n319 ingredient or active moiety. We recommend th at the confidence interval approach be \\n320 applied to the metabolite data obtained from these studies.   \\n321 322 \\uf0b7 Measurement of a metabolite(s) is necessary in addition to the active ingredient or \\n323 active moiety if the metabolite is formed by presystemic metabolism and contributes \\n324 meaningfully to efficacy and/or safety.  The confidence interval approach should be \\n325 used for all moieties measured.  However, the BE criteria are only generally applied \\n326 to the active ingredient or active moiet y.  Sponsors should contact the appropriate \\n327 review division to determine which moieties should be measured.  \\n328 \\n329 9. Pharmacokinetic Measures of Systemic Exposure  \\n330 \\n331 This guidance recommends that systemic expos ure measures be used to evaluate BA and \\n332 BE. Exposure measures are defined relative to  peak, partial, and to tal portions of the \\n333 plasma, serum, or blood concentration-time profile, as describe here: \\n334 \\n335 \\uf0b7 Peak Exposure \\n336 \\n337 We recommend that peak exposure be assessed by measuring the C\\nmax obtained directly \\n338 from the systemic drug concentration data without interpolation.  The T max can provide \\n339 important information about the rate of abso rption.  The first point  of a concentration\\xad\\n340 time curve based on blood and/or plasma measurements is sometimes the highest \\n341 concentration, which raises a questio n about the measurement of true C max because of \\n342 insufficient early sampling times.  A carefu lly conducted pilot study may help to avoid \\n343 this problem.  Collection of an early time  point between 5 and 15 minutes after dosing \\n344 followed by additional sample collections (e.g., tw o to five) in the first hour after dosing \\n345 may be sufficient to assess early peak concentrations.  If this sampling approach is \\n346 followed, we consider the data to be ad equate, even when the highest observed \\n347 concentration occurs at the first time point. \\n348 \\n349 \\uf0b7 Total Exposure (Exten t of Absorption) \\n350 \\n351 For single-dose studies, we recommend that the measurement of total exposure be: \\n352 353 -Area under the plasma, serum, or blood concentration time curve from time zero \\n354 to time t (AUC\\n0-t), where t is the last time point with a measurable concentration. \\n355 356 -Area under the plasma, serum, or blood concentration time curve from time zero \\n357 to time infinity (AUC\\n0-\\uf0a5), where AUC 0-\\uf0a5 = AUC 0-t + C t/\\uf06cz. Ct is the last \\n358 measurable drug concentration and \\uf06cz is the terminal or elimination rate constant \\n359 calculated according to an appropriate method. \\n9\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '12', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For certain classes of drugs and under certain \\n373 circumstances (e.g., to assess onset of an anal gesic effect), an evaluation of the partial \\n374 exposure could be used to support the perfor mance of different formulations by providing \\n375 further evidence of therapeutic effect. This  guidance recommends the use of partial AUC \\n376 as a partial exposure measure. The time to trun cate the partial area shou ld be related to a \\n377 clinically relevant PD measure. We also recommend that sufficient quantifiable samples \\n378 be collected to allow adequate estimation of the partial area.  For questions on the \\n379 suitability of the PD measure or use of partial exposure in  general, we recommend that \\n380 sponsors and/or applicants consult the appropriate review division.  \\n381 \\n382 10. Comparison of PK measures in BE studies \\n383 \\n384 An equivalence approach is recommended for BE comparisons.  The recommended \\n385 approach relies on (1) a criterion to allow the comparison, (2 ) a confidence interval for \\n386 the criterion, and (3) a BE limit.  Log-tr ansformation of exposure measures before \\n387 statistical analysis is reco mmended.  This guidance recommends use of an average BE \\n388 criterion to compare systemic exposure m easures for replicate and nonreplicate BE \\n389 studies of both immediate- and modified-rel ease products.  For additional information on \\n390 data analysis, refer to Appendix A and to the FDA guidance for industry on Statistical \\n391 Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence. \\n392 \\n393 B. Other Approaches to Support BA/BE \\n394 \\n395 In certain circumstances, other approaches ar e recommended to support a demonstration of \\n396 BA/BE. Below are some general considerations  regarding these other approaches.  Sponsors \\n397 should consult FDA’s guidances for industry for additional information on these methods as \\n398 well.14 \\n399 \\n400 1.

      "page_content=' \\n \\n \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\n\\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n402 In vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) is an  approach to describe the relationship \\n403 between an in vitro attribute of a dosage form (e.g., the rate or extent of drug \\n404 release) and a relevant in vivo respon se (e.g., plasma drug concentration or \\n405 amount of drug absorbed).  This mode l relationship facilitates the rational \\n406 development and evaluation of extended-re lease dosage forms.  Once an IVIVC is \\n407 validated, the in vitro test serves as a su rrogate for BA and/or BE testing, as well \\n408 as a tool for formulation screening an d setting of the dissolution/drug-release \\n409 acceptance criteria.  \\n410  \\n411 Specifically, in vitro dissolution/drug-rel ease characterization is encouraged for \\n412 all extended-release product formulati ons investigated (i ncluding prototype \\n413 formulations), particularly if in vivo ab sorption characteristics are being defined \\n414 for the different product formulations.  Such efforts may enable the establishment \\n415 of an IVIVC. When an IVIVC or association is established (21 CFR \\n416 320.24(b)(1)(ii)), the in vitr o test can serve not on ly as a quality control \\n417 specification for the manufacturing process,  but also as an indicator of how the \\n418 product will perform in vivo .  \\n419  \\n420 Additional information on the developmen t and validation of an IVIVC can be \\n421 found in the FDA guidance for industry Extended Release Oral Dosage Forms: \\n422 Development, Evaluation, and Application of In Vitro/In Vivo Correlations .  \\n423  \\n424 2. Pharmacodynamic Studies \\n425  \\n426 PD studies are not recommended for ora lly administered drug products when the \\n427 drug is absorbed into systemic circula tion and a PK approach can be used to \\n428 assess systemic exposure and evaluate BA  or BE.  PK endpoints are preferred \\n429 because they are generally the most  accurate, sensitive,  and reproducible \\n430 approach. However, in instances wher e a PK endpoint is not possible, a well\\xad\\n431 justified PD endpoint can be used  to demonstrate BA or BE.  \\n432  \\n433 3. Comparative Clinical Studies \\n434  \\n435 Clinical endpoints can be used in limite d circumstances, for example, for orally \\n436 administered drug products when the m easurement of the active ingredients or \\n437 active moieties in an accessible biological  fluid (PK approach) or PD approach is \\n438 not possible.  Because these circumstances  do not occur very often, use of this \\n439 approach is expected to be rare.  \\n440  \\n441 4. In Vitro Studies \\n442  \\n443 Under certain circumstances, BA and BE can be evaluated using in vitro \\n444 approaches (e.g., dissolution/drug-releas e testing) during the preapproval and \\n445 postapproval phases (see 21 CFR 320.24(b)(5) and (6)).

DOCUMENTING BA AND BE FO R VARIOUS DOSAGE FORMS \\n465 \\n466 This section summarizes the recommendations fo r documenting BA and BE studies based on the \\n467 specific dosage forms and whether these evalua tions occur preaapproval  or postapproval. \\n468 \\n469 A. Solutions and Other Solubilized Dosage Forms \\n470 \\n471 For oral solutions, elixirs, syrups, tinctures, or other solubilized forms, in vivo BA and/or BE  are \\n472 generally self-evident and a requirement of in vivo data for a product may be waived (21 CFR \\n473 320.22(b)(3)). In such instances, the applicant would be deemed to have complied with and \\n474 fulfilled any requirement for in vivo data.16 Although a comparative study is not necessary, \\n475 characterization of the pharmacokinetics of the drug is required (21 CFR 314.50(d)(3)).  In \\n476 addition, in vivo BE studies that compare different solution formulations are waived based on the \\n477 assumptions that release of drug substance from the drug product is self-evident and that the \\n478 solutions do not contain any excipi ents that significantly affect drug absorption.  However, there \\n479 are certain excipients that may alter the BA  (e.g., sorbitol may reduce the BA of drugs, and \\n480 vitamin E may enhance the BA) in amounts sometimes used in oral liquid dosage forms.  In this \\n481 case, evaluation of in vivo BA  and/or BE may be required.  \\n482 \\n483 B. Immediate-Release Products \\n484 \\n485 Included in this discussion are capsules, tablets (including conventional, buccal, chewable, orally \\n486 disintegrating, and sublingual dosag e forms), and suspensions.  \\n15 See the FDA guidance for industry on Waiver of In Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for \\nImmediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Based on a Biopharmaceutics Classification System .

Preapproval Changes \\n489  \\n490 For BA and BE studies, we recommend a singl e-dose, fasting study be performed.  Under \\n491 certain circumstances, multiple-dose BA studies  (see section III.A.5) and/or food effect \\n492 studies may be necessary (See the FDA guidance for industry Food-Effect Bioavailability \\n493 and Fed Bioequivalence). Unconventional dosage forms (buccal, chewable, orally \\n494 disintegrating, and sublingua l dosage forms) should be administered according to \\n495 intended label use/instructi ons.  In addition, a BA study may be needed with the \\n496 unconventional dosage form swallowed intact  to assess the impact of accidental \\n497 swallowing of the intact product. Sampling should adequately capture the T max and C max  \\n498 in addition to total exposure. \\n499  \\n500 We recommend that in vitro dissolution be eval uated for all orally administered products.  \\n501 In vitro dissolution test conditions could be the same or different for unconventional \\n502 compared to conventional dosage forms.  If di fferences in dissolution data exist, they \\n503 should be discussed with the appropriate review division.  \\n504  \\n505 2.  Postapproval Changes \\n506  \\n507 Information on the types of in vitro disso lution and in vivo BE studies needed for \\n508 approved immediate-release drug products when postapproval changes are made is \\n509 provided in an FDA guidance for industry entitled SUPAC-IR: Immediate Release Solid \\n510 Oral Dosage Forms Scale-Up and Postapprov al Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, \\n511 and Controls, In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation . \\n512 We recommend that for postapproval changes, th e in vitro or in vivo comparison be made \\n513 between the post-change and pre-change products. \\n514  \\n515 C.  Modified-Release Products  \\n516  \\n517 Modified-release (MR) products include exte nded-release (controlled-release, sustained-\\n518 release)17 and delayed-release products. \\n519  \\n520 Extended-release (ER) products are dosage forms that are designed to extend or prolong the \\n521 release of active ingredient or  active moiety from the drug pr oduct and may allow a reduction in \\n522 dosing frequency as compared to when the drug is administered in an immediate-release (IR) \\n523 dosage form. These drug products can be developed to reduce fluctuations in plasma  \\n524 concentrations when compared to an IR product. ER products can be capsules, tablets, granules, \\n525 pellets, or suspensions. \\n526  \\n527 Delayed-release (DR) drug products are dosage fo rms that release active ingredient or active \\n528 moiety at a time later than immediately after administration (i.e., these drug products exhibit a \\n529 lag time in quantifiable plasma concentrations).  Typically, coatings (e.g. , enteric coatings) are \\n                                                 \\n17  For the purpose of this guidance, the terms extended , controlled , and  sustained are used interchangeably. \\n13\\n\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '16', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

However, if \\n532 the DR product has complex release characteristic s, the relevant review division should be \\n533 contacted for additional guidance. \\n534  \\n535 If the drug product is an ER product, the following recommendations apply. \\n536  \\n537 1.  Preapproval: BA and BE Studies \\n538  \\n539 FDA’s regulations at 21 CFR 320.25(f) addr ess the purpose of a BA study for an \\n540 extended-release product, which is to determine if certain delineated conditions are met.18     \\n541 This regulation also provides that “the refe rence material(s) for such a bioavailability  \\n542 study shall be chosen to permit an appropria te scientific evaluation of the extended \\n543 release claims made for the drug product.”19  Appropriate reference products may include \\n544 (1) a solution or suspension of  the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety, (2) a \\n545 currently marketed non-controlled-release dr ug product containing the same active drug \\n546 ingredient or therapeutic moiety a nd administered according to the dosage \\n547 recommendations in the labeling of the non- controlled release drug product, and (3) a \\n548 currently marketed ER drug product subject  to an approved fu ll NDA containing the \\n549 same active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety and administered according to the \\n550 dosage recommendations in the labeling of currently marketed ER product.20  \\n551  \\n552 In general, the PK profile of the ER pr oduct may not match that of the approved IR \\n553 product (e.g., T max is different) or, in some cases, to another ER product. In such a case, \\n554 establishing similar PK profiles using C max and AUC may not be sufficient to show that \\n555 the ER product is bioequivalent to the IR product.  Thus, additional safety or efficacy \\n556 studies or PK/PD assessments may be reco mmended. This guidance recommends that the \\n557 following BA studies and food effect BA studies be conducted for an ER drug product \\n558 submitted as an NDA for the scenarios described below: \\n559  \\n560 New ER formulation comparison to an already-approved IR product  \\n561  \\n562 \\uf0b7  For drugs with linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range:  A fasting \\n563 study should be conducted comparing the ER  product administered as a single \\n564 dose at the highest strength to the IR reference administered over the least \\n565 common time interval to achieve equiva lent total dose as for the ER product.21 If \\n                                                 \\n18 21 CFR 320.25(f)(1). \\n19 21 CFR 320.25(f)(2). \\n20  21  CFR 320.25(f)(2)(i), (ii), and (iv).

In other delineated circumstances, an in vivo BA or BE data \\n643 requirement may be waived, and in vitro data may be accepted in lieu of in vivo data (21 CFR \\n644 320.22(d)). For example, an in vivo data requirem ent may be waived for different strengths of \\n645 an immediate-release drug product under 21 CF R 320.22(d)(2) when (1) the drug product is in \\n646 the same dosage form, but in a different strength;  (2) this different strength is proportionally \\n647 similar in its active and inactive ingredient s to another drug product for which the same \\n648 manufacturer has obtained approval;  and (3) the new strength meets an appropriate in vitro test \\n649 as outlined in the regulation.26 In addition, for waiving higher strengths, linearity of the \\n650 pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range should be demonstrated. \\n651 \\n652 This guidance defines proportionally similar in the following ways: \\n653 \\n654 \\uf0b7 All active and inactive ingredients are in exactly the same proportion between different \\n655 strengths (e.g., a tablet of 50-mg strength has al l the inactive ingredient s, exactly half that \\n656 of a tablet of 100-mg strength, and twice that of a tablet of 25-mg strength). \\n657 658 \\uf0b7 For high-potency drug substances (where the amount of active dr ug substance in the \\n659 dosage form is relatively low), (1) the total weight of the dosage form remains nearly the \\n660 same for all strengths (within ± 10 % of the to tal weight of the strength on which a BE \\n661 was performed), (2) the same inactive ingredie nts are used for all st rengths, and (3) the \\n662 change in any strength is obtained by altering the amount of the active ingredients and \\n663 one or more of the inactive ingredients.   \\n664 665 \\uf0b7 Bilayer tablets are considered to be one formulation even though they consist of two \\n666 separate layers with different compositions.  In assessing the proportional similarity of \\n667 the different strengths, all components of both layers should be proportionally similar.  \\n668 The fact that only one layer is proportionally si milar and the other is not clearly indicates \\n669 that the products (whole tablet) are not propor tionally similar. This is relevant because \\n670 there can be interactions between the different tablet layers, which can differ across \\n671 different strengths because of the different size of the layers and the varying amounts of \\n672 excipients present in each layer. \\n673 \\n674 Exceptions to the above definitions may be possibl e if adequate justification is provided and \\n675 discussed with the appropriate review division. \\n676 \\n677 B.

Also, FDA, for good cause, may waive a \\nrequirement for the submission of evidence of in vivo bioa vailability or bioequivalence if waiver is compatible with \\nthe protection of the public health.

      "page_content=' \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\n \\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n \\n679 FDA may determine that in vitro data are the most accurate, sensitive, and reproducible method \\n680 to demonstrate BA or BE in other contexts (21 CF R 320.24(b)(5) and (6)).27 Below we provide \\n681 additional guidance on the conduct of such studies.   \\n682  \\n683 1. Immediate-Release Formulations (Capsules, Tablets, and Suspensions) \\n684  \\n685 In vitro data can be used to compare formulations of drug products under certain \\n686 circumstances.  If an applicant seeks to de monstrate the BA or BE of immediate-release \\n687 formulations for capsules, tablets, and suspensions using in vitro data, FDA recommends \\n688 that sponsors generate dissolution profiles for all strengths using an appropriate \\n689 dissolution method.  If the disso lution results indicate that the dissolution characteristics \\n690 of the product are not dependent on the pH and product strength, dissolution profiles in \\n691 one medium are usually sufficient to support demonstrating BE.  Ot herwise, dissolution \\n692 data in at least three media (e.g., pH  1.2, 4.5, and 6.8) are re commended.  The f 2 test \\n693 should be used to compare profiles from the different strengths of the product (see FDA \\n694 guidance for industry, Dissolution Testing of Immediat e Release Solid Oral Dosage \\n695 Forms ). An f 2 value > 50 indicates a sufficiently similar dissolution pr ofile to support a \\n696 biowaiver. For an f 2 value < 50, discussion with the appropriate review division is \\n697 recommended to determine whether an  in vivo study is needed.  The f 2 approach is not \\n698 suitable for rapidly dissolving dr ug products (e.g., > 85% dissolved in 15 minutes or less).  \\n699  \\n700 \\uf0b7  Over-encapsulation of clin ical trial formulations  \\n701  \\n702 During the course of drug development,  sponsors sometimes have to blind the \\n703 formulations that they use in the clinical trials.  In certain situations, the only difference  \\n704 between the to-be-marketed and clinical trial formulations is  that the dosage form is put \\n705 into a capsule. This over-encapsulation is done  mainly for blinding purposes.  It may be \\n706 possible to support bioequivalence of the to-b e-marketed and clinical trial formulations \\n707 using in vitro data only, provided that no other excipients are added to the capsule and the \\n708 dissolution profiles are comparable in three media:  pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8.  \\n709  \\n710 \\uf0b7  Scale-up and postapproval changes \\n711  \\n712 Certain formulation changes in component s and composition, scale-up, manufacturing \\n713 site, manufacturing process, or equipment can be made postapproval.  Depending on the \\n714 possible impact of the manufacturing change on the release of the active ingredient from  \\n715 the formulation and its BA, certain manufacturing changes for IR products can be \\n716 approved based solely on similarity of the dissolution profiles between the postchange \\n717 and prechange formulations.  Informati on on recommendations for using in vitro \\n718 dissolution and in vivo BE studies for i mmediate-release drug products in such \\n719 circumstances is provided in FDA’s guidance for industry on SUPAC IR:   Immediate-\\n720 Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes: Chemistry, \\n721 Manufacturing, and Controls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence \\n                                                 \\n27 In such instances, no waiver under 21 CFR  320.21 and 320.22 is  necessary.  \\n18\\n\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '21', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The same principles described in the guidance can be applied to \\n723 pre-approval changes in which the to-be-marketed formulation differs from the clinical \\n724 trial formulation.  \\n725  \\n726 2. Modified-Release Formulations \\n727  \\n728 The use of in vitro data may be acceptable for modified-release drug products for which \\n729 specific postapproval changes are sought is de lineated in the FDA guidance for industry \\n730 SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Do sage Forms: Scale-Up and Postapproval \\n731 Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Contro ls; In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In \\n732 Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation. The same principles described in the guidance may \\n733 also apply to preapproval change s.  Additional considerations for use of in vitro data are \\n734 described below. \\n735  \\n736 \\uf0b7  Beaded capsules: lower/higher strength \\n737  \\n738 For ER beaded capsules where the strengt h differs only in the number of beads \\n739 containing the active moiety, a single-dose, fasting BA or BE study, as appropriate, \\n740 should be carried out on the highest strength. In vivo BA or BE of one or more lower \\n741 strengths can be demonstrated based on disso lution profile comparis ons, with an in vivo \\n742 BA or BE study only on the highest strength (unless safety reasons preclude the \\n743 administration of the highest strength to healthy volunteers) . The dissolution profiles for \\n744 each strength should be generated using th e recommended dissolution method.  If the \\n745 dissolution method has not been finalized, disso lution profiles should be generated in at \\n746 least three media (e.g., pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8). In vivo BE studies for higher strengths may \\n747 not be necessary based on (1) clinical safety and/or efficacy data on the proposed dose \\n748 and the need for the higher strength, (2 ) linearity of pharmacokinetics over the \\n749 therapeutic dose range, and (3) the same dissolution procedures being used for all \\n750 strengths with similar dissolution results.  The f 2 test can be used to demonstrate similar \\n751 profiles among the different strengths of the product.   \\n752  \\n753 \\uf0b7  MR dosage forms: lower strength \\n754  \\n755 For MR dosage forms, when the drug product is in the same dosage form but in a \\n756 different strength and when (1) the drug exhi bits linear pharmacokinetics, (2) the various \\n757 strengths are proportionally similar in their active and inactive ingredients28 and (3) the \\n758 drug-release mechanism is the same, an in vi vo BA or BE determination of one or more \\n759 lower strengths can be demonstrated based on dissolution profile comparisons, with an in \\n760 vivo BA or BE study only on the highest strength.  The dissolution profiles for each \\n761 strength should be generated using th e recommended dissolution method.  If the \\n762 dissolution method has not been finalized, disso lution profiles should be generated in at \\n                                                 \\n28 If the formulations of all the strengths are not compositi onally proportional, in  vitro data can  be submitted  for the \\nmiddle strength(s) if the following data are acceptable: (1) BA or BE data, as appropriate, for both the highest and \\nthe lowest strengths, and (2) in  vitro multimedia dissolution comparison  profiles using f2 evaluation.    \\n19\\n\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '22', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The dissolution profile should be \\n764 generated on the test and reference products of all strengths usi ng the same dissolution \\n765 test conditions. \\n766  \\n767 VI.  SPECIAL TOPICS  \\n768  \\n769 A.  Alcoholic Beverage Effects on MR Drug Products \\n770  \\n771 The consumption of alcoholic beverages may affect  the release of a drug substance from an MR \\n772 formulation.  The formulation may lose its MR characteristics, leading to more rapid drug release \\n773 and altered systemic exposure.  This more rapi d drug release may have deleterious effects on the \\n774 drug's safety and/or efficacy. \\n775  \\n776 In vitro assessments of the drug release from  the drug product using media with various alcohol \\n777 concentrations should be conducted.  Based on the results of the in vitro assessments, an in vivo \\n778 BA study of the drug product when administered with alcohol may be needed.    \\n779  \\n780 B.  Enantiomers versus Racemates \\n781  \\n782 During development of a racemic drug product, the racemate should be measured in BA studies.  \\n783 It may also be important to measure the indivi dual enantiomers of the racemate to characterize \\n784 the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers.  For the development of a specific enantiomer, chiral \\n785 inversion should be assessed. \\n786  \\n787 Measurement of the racemate using an achir al assay is recommended for BE studies.  \\n788 Measurement of individual enantiomers in BE  studies is recommended only when all of the \\n789 following conditions are met:  (1) the enantiomers exhibit different PD characteristics, (2) the \\n790 enantiomers exhibit different PK characteristics,  (3) primary efficacy and safety activity resides \\n791 with the minor enantiomer, and (4) nonlinear abso rption is present (as expressed by a change in \\n792 the enantiomer concentration ratio with change in the input rate of the dr ug) for at least one of \\n793 the enantiomers.  In such cases, we recommend that BE criteria be applied to the enantiomers \\n794 separately. \\n795  \\n796 C.  Drug Products With Complex Mixt ures as the Active Ingredients \\n797  \\n798 Certain drug products may cont ain complex drug substances (i .e., active moieties or active \\n799 ingredients that are mixtures of multiple synthetic  and/or natural source components).  Some or \\n800 all of the components of these complex drug subs tances may not be fully characterized with \\n801 regard to chemical structure and/ or biological activity.  Quantifica tion of all active or potentially \\n802 active components in BA and BE studies may not be possible.  In such cases, we recommend \\n803 that BA and BE studies be based on a select number of components.  Criteria for component \\n804 selection typically include the amount of the moie ty in the dosage form, plasma or blood levels \\n805 of the moiety, and biological ac tivity of the moiety.  When PK approaches are infeasible to \\n806 assess rate and extent of absorp tion of a drug substance from a dr ug product, PD, clinical, or in \\n807 vitro approaches may be appropriate.  \\n20\\n \" metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '23', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content=' \\n Draft — Not for Implementation \\n \\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations \\n \\n808  \\n809 D.  Long-Half-Life Drugs \\n810  \\n811 In a BA or PK study involving an IR  oral product with a long half-life (≥  24 hours), adequate \\n812 characterization of the half-lif e should include blood sampling over a long period of time.  For \\n813 BA or BE determination of a drug product containi ng a drug with a long half -life, a nonreplicate, \\n814 single-dose, crossover study can be conducted, provide d an adequate washout period is used.  If \\n815 the crossover study is problematic, a study with a parallel design can be used.  For either a \\n816 crossover or parallel study, we recommend that the sample collection time be adequate to ensure \\n817 completion of gastrointestinal transit (approxi mately 2 to 3 days) of the drug product and \\n818 absorption of the drug substance. C max and a suitably truncated AUC can be used to characterize \\n819 peak and total drug exposure, respectively. Fo r drugs that demonstr ate low intrasubject \\n820 variability in distribution and clearance, a truncated AUC (e.g., AUC 0-72 hr ) can be used in place \\n821 of AUC 0-t or AUC 0-\\uf0a5. For drugs that demonstrate high intr asubject variability in distribution and \\n822 clearance, AUC truncation should not be used.  In such cases, we recommend that sponsors \\n823 and/or applicants consult the appropriate review division. \\n824  \\n825 E.  Orally Administered Drugs Intended for Local Action  \\n826  \\n827 Documentation of BA and BE when the drug substa nce produces its effects by local action in the \\n828 gastrointestinal tract can be achieved either by using pharmacokinetics, an acceptable PD end \\n829 point, clinical efficacy and safety studies, and/or  suitably designed and vali dated in vitro studies, \\n830 as appropriate. For such cases, we recommend that sponsors and/or applicants consult the \\n831 appropriate review division. Additional safety st udies may also be recommended to characterize \\n832 the local safety of the product. The in vitro studi es should reflect important  clinical effects or \\n833 should be more sensitive to changes in product pe rformance compared to a clinical study.  To \\n834 ensure comparable safety, additional studies wi th and without food may help to understand the \\n835 degree of systemic exposure that occurs followi ng administration of a drug product intended for \\n836 local action in the gastrointestinal tract.  \\n837  \\n838 F.  Combination/Coadministered Drug Products \\n839  \\n840 Two or more active ingredients can  be formulated as a single dr ug product, which is referred to \\n841 as a combination drug product.  Generally, th e purpose of an in vivo BA study involving a \\n842 combination drug product is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of each active drug \\n843 ingredient or therapeutic moiety in the combin ation drug product to th e rate and extent of \\n844 absorption of each active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety administered concurrently in \\n845 separate single-ingredient preparations (21 CFR 320.25(g). \\n846  \\n847 For the purpose of defining BA or determining BE when required, this guidance recommends \\n848 that the following studies be conduc ted for a combination drug product: \\n849  \\n850 \\uf0b7  A two-treatment, single-dose, fasting study of the combination drug product versus \\n851 single-ingredient drug products administered concurrently as a single treatment or an \\n852 approved combination product containing the sa me active ingredients.  This study should \\n21\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '24', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For instance, in the case of  a combination product consisting of two \\n858 components, a three-treatment study desi gn comparing the combination drug product \\n859 versus single-ingredient drug products admi nistered separately may be appropriate. \\n860 861 \\uf0b7 A single-dose, food-effect study on the combination drug product. \\n862 \\n863 BE studies for the combination product s hould include the measurement of systemic \\n864 concentrations of each active ingredient.  The co nfidence interval approach should be applied to \\n865 each measured entity of the combination drug product and its reference product.  \\n866 867 In specific cases, drug products are given in comb ination (not co-formulated) with the objective \\n868 of increasing the exposure of one of the drugs (s ubject drug).  The second drug is not intended to \\n869 have a therapeutic effect and is given only to in crease the systemic exposure of the subject drug.  \\n870 When both the subject and second drug are new mo lecular entities, the BA of each should be \\n871 assessed separately. If a BE study is needed for the subject drug for any reason, the subject drug \\n872 should be administered with the second drug for both test and reference products.  The \\n873 corresponding PK results, includi ng confidence intervals for BE crite ria, should be applied to the \\n874 subject drug. It is not necessa ry to measure the concentrations  of the second drug.  BE studies \\n875 that are needed for the second drug should be conducted only with the second drug; the subject \\n876 drug is not dosed with the second drug.  When the combination includes a new molecular entity \\n877 and an approved product, only the BA of the new molecular entity should be assessed.  It is \\n878 assumed that the BA of the approved product has been previously evaluated.    \\n879 \\n880 G. Endogenous Substances \\n881 \\n882 Drug products can be developed that contain compounds that are endog enous to humans (e.g., \\n883 testosterone). When the endogenous compounds are identical to the drug that is being \\n884 administered, determining the amount of drug re leased from the dosage form and absorbed by \\n885 each subject is difficult. In most cases, it is important to measure and approximate the baseline \\n886 endogenous levels of the compound in blood (plasma)  and subtract these levels from the total \\n887 concentrations measured from each subject after the drug product is administered.  In this way, \\n888 an estimate of actual drug availability from the drug product can be achieved, and therefore BA \\n889 and BE can be assessed. Endogenous substances may have homeostatic processes that affect \\n890 their production and therefore imp act their systemic concentrati ons. To reduce the complication \\n891 of these homeostatic processes and to potentia lly avoid the need for baseline correction, an \\n892 alternative approach might be to  enroll patients in BA and BE studies with low or no production \\n893 of the endogenous substances in stead of healthy volunteers. \\n894 895 Baseline concentrations of th e endogenous substance produced by the body are measured in the \\n896 time period prior to study drug administra tion.  Depending on the proposed indication, \\n897 subtraction of the time-averaged baseline or time-matched baseline from the post-dose \\n22\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '25', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

When the endogenous levels are \\n899 influenced by diet, strict control of the diet ary intake of the compound prior to and during the \\n900 study may also be appropriate.  To achieve a stable baseline, subjects should be housed at the \\n901 clinic for a sufficient time prior to the study and served standardized meals with similar content \\n902 of the compound to that of the meal s served on the PK sampling day. \\n903  \\n904 In either case, baseline concentrations should be determined for each dosing period, and baseline \\n905 corrections should be period-specific.  If a negative plasma c oncentration value results after \\n906 baseline correction, this should be set to 0 pr ior to calculating the ba seline-corrected AUC.  \\n907 Pharmacokinetics and statistical analysis should be performed on both uncorrected and corrected \\n908 data as appropriate.  Because of the complex ities associated with endogenous compounds, we \\n909 recommend that sponsors and/or ap plicants contact the appropriate review division for additional \\n910 guidance. \\n911  \\n912 H.  Drug Products With High Intrasubject Variability  \\n913  \\n914 In addition to the traditional approach and the us e of average BE using replicate designs, the use \\n915 of a reference-scaled BE approach using a repl icate design can be considered.  This approach \\n916 should be reserved for drugs that dem onstrate a high intrasubject variability ( ≥30%). The \\n917 reference-scaled average BE approach adjusts th e BE limits of highly variable drugs by scaling \\n918 to the within-subject vari ability of the reference product in th e study and imposes a limit of 0.8 to \\n919 1.25 on the geometric mean ratio.29 The appropriate review division should be consulted when \\n920 planning the use of the reference-scaled BE approach. \\n921  \\n922 \\n29 For general principles of the reference-scaled approach , refer to Davit B, Conner D.

If \\n939 warranted, to achieve sufficient bioanalytical sensitivity multiple units of the highest strength \\n940 can be administered, provided the total single  dose remains within the labeled dose range and \\n941 the total dose is safe for administration to the study subjects. \\n942 \\n943 \\uf0b7 An adequate washout period (e.g., \\uf0b35 half-lives of the moieties to be measured) should \\n944 separate each treatment. \\n945 \\n946 \\uf0b7 The lot numbers of both test and reference li sted products and the expiration date for the \\n947 reference product should be stated. We recomme nd that the assayed drug  content of the test \\n948 product batch not differ from the reference product by more than +/- 5 percent.  The sponsor \\n949 should include a statement of the composition of the test product and, if possible, a side-by\\xad\\n950 side comparison of the compositions of test and reference listed products.  In accordance \\n951 with 21 CFR 320.38, and 21 CFR 320.63, samples of the test and reference listed product \\n952 must be retained for at least 5 years.

This sampling should continue for at least three or more \\n970 terminal elimination half-lives of the drug  to capture 90 percent of the relevant AUC.  For \\n971 multiple-dose studies, sampling should occur across the dose interval and include the \\n972 beginning and the end of the interval. The exact  timing for sample collection depends on the \\n973 nature of the drug and the rate of input from  the administered dosage form.  The sample \\n974 collection should be spaced in such a way that the maximum concentration (C max) of the drug \\n975 in the blood and terminal elimination rate constant ( \\uf06cz) can be estimated accurately.\\n \\n976 \\n977 Three or more samples should be obtained during the terminal log-linear phase to obtain an \\n978 accurate estimate of \\uf06cz from linear regression.  We reco mmend recording the actual clock \\n979 time when samples are drawn, as well as th e elapsed time related to drug administration. \\n980 \\n981 Subjects with pre-dose pl asma concentrations \\n982 \\n983 \\uf0b7 If the pre-dose concentration is \\uf0a3 5 percent of C max value in that subject, the subject’s data \\n984 without any adjustments can be included in all PK measurements and calculations.  We \\n985 recommend that if the pre-dose value is > 5 percent of C max, the subject should be dropped \\n986 from all PK evaluations.  The subject data should be reported and the subject should be \\n987 included in safety evaluations. \\n988 \\n989 Data deletion because of vomiting \\n990 \\n991 \\uf0b7 We recommend that data from subjects who e xperience emesis during the course of a study \\n992 for immediate-release products be deleted from statistical analysis if vomiting occurs at or \\n993 before 2 times median T max. For modified-release products, subjects who experience emesis \\n994 at any time during the labeled dosing interval should not be included in PK analysis. \\n995 \\n996 Data submission and analysis\\n \\n997 \\n998 The following PK information is recommended for submission: \\n999 \\n1000 \\uf0b7 Plasma concentrations and time points. \\n1001 \\uf0b7 Subject, period, sequence, treatment.  \\n1002 \\uf0b7 Intersubject, intrasubject, and/or total variability, if available.\\n \\n1003 \\uf0b7 For single-dose studies: AUC 0-t, AUC 0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, \\uf06cz, and t 1/2. \\n1004 \\uf0b7 For steady-state studies:  AUC 0-tau, Cmaxss, Tmax, Cminss (lowest concentration in a dosing \\n1005 interval), C trough (concentration at the end of the dosing interval), C avss (average \\n1006 concentration during a dosing interv al), degree of fluctuation [(C max-Cmin)/C avss], swing \\n1007 [(C maxss-Cminss)/C minss]. C trough should be measured for seve ral dosing intervals to assess \\n1008 whether steady-state was achieved. \\n25\\n ' metadata={'source': 'Bioavailability-and-Bioequivalence-Studies-Submitted-in-NDAs-or-INDs-—-General-Considerations.pdf', 'page': '28', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In the case of food packed in random packages at one place for subsequent shipment and sale at another, the price sections of the label may be left blank provided they are filled in by the seller prior to retail sale. This exemption shall also apply to uniform weight packages of cheese and cheese products labeled in the same manner and by the same type of equip-ment as random food packages exempt-ed by this paragraph (a)(2) except that the labels shall bear a declaration of price per pound and not price per speci-fied number of pounds. \\n(3) Individual serving-size packages \\nof foods containing less than \\n1⁄2ounce \\nor less than 1⁄2fluid ounce for use in \\nrestaurants, institutions, and pas-senger carriers, and not intended for sale at retail, shall be exempt from the required declaration of net quantity of contents specified in this part. \\n(4) Individually wrapped pieces of \\npenny candy and other confectionery of \\nless than one-half ounce net weight per individual piece shall be exempt from the labeling requirements of this part when the container in which such con-fectionery is shipped is in conformance with the labeling requirements of this part. Similarly, when such confec-tionery items are sold in bags or boxes, such items shall be exempt from the la-beling requirements of this part, in-cluding the required declaration of net \\nquantity of contents specified in this part when the declaration on the bag or box meets the requirements of this part. \\n(5)(i) Soft drinks packaged in bottles \\nshall be exempt from the placement re-quirements for the statement of iden-tity prescribed by §101.3 (a) and (d) of this chapter if such statement appears conspicuously on the bottle closure. When such soft drinks are marketed in a multiunit retail package, the multi-unit retail package shall be exempt from the statement of identity declara-tion requirements prescribed by §101.3 of this chapter if the statement of iden-tity on the unit container is not ob-scured by the multiunit retail package. \\n(ii) A multiunit retail package for \\nsoft drinks shall be exempt from the declaration regarding name and place of business required by §101.5 of this chapter if the package does not obscure the declaration on unit containers or if it bears a statement that the declara-tion can be found on the unit con-tainers and the declaration on the unit containers complies with §101.5 of this chapter.

A facility is not exempt under this provision if the further man-ufacturing/processing (including pack-aging) conducted by the subsequent fa-cility consists of adding labeling or any similar activity of a de minimis nature; (b) Farms; \\n(c) Retail food establishments; (d) Restaurants; (e) Nonprofit food establishments in \\nwhich food is prepared for, or served di-rectly to, the consumer; \\n(f) Fishing vessels, including those \\nthat not only harvest and transport fish but also engage in practices such as heading, eviscerating, or freezing in-tended solely to prepare fish for hold-ing on board a harvest vessel. However, those fishing vessels otherwise engaged in processing fish are subject to this subpart. For the purposes of this sec-tion, ‘‘processing’’ means handling, storing, preparing, shucking, changing into different market forms, manufac-turing, preserving, packing, labeling, dockside unloading, holding, or head-ing, eviscerating, or freezing other \\nthan solely to prepare fish for holding on board a harvest vessel; \\n(g) Facilities that are regulated ex-\\nclusively, throughout the entire facil-ity, by the U.S. Department of Agri-culture under the Federal Meat Inspec-tion Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Poul-\\ntry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq. ), or the Egg Products Inspec-\\ntion Act (21 U.S.C. 1031 et seq. ); \\n§ 1.227 What definitions apply to this \\nsubpart? \\nThe definitions of terms in section \\n201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act apply to such terms when used in this subpart.

A pri-\\nmary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) phys-ical location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the rais-ing of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term ‘‘farm’’ includes operations that, in addition to these activities: \\n(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural \\ncommodities; \\n(ii) Pack or hold processed food, pro-\\nvided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)( 1) of \\nthis definition; and \\n(iii) Manufacture/process food, pro-\\nvided that: \\n(A) All food used in such activities is \\nconsumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or \\n(B) Any manufacturing/processing of \\nfood that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same man-agement consists only of: \\n(1) Drying/dehydrating raw agricul-\\ntural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehy-drating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commod-ities, without additional manufac-turing/processing (an example of addi-tional manufacturing/processing is slicing); \\n(2) Treatment to manipulate the rip-\\nening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and label-ing treated raw agricultural commod-ities, without additional manufac-\\nturing/processing; and \\n(3) Packaging and labeling raw agri-\\ncultural commodities, when these ac-tivities do not involve additional man-ufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or \\n(2) Secondary activities farm. A sec-\\nondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commod-ities, provided that the primary pro-duction farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary ac-tivities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those addi-tional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in para-graphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition. \\nFood has the meaning given in sec-\\ntion 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: \\n(1) Except for purposes of this sub-\\npart, it does not include: \\n(i) Food contact substances as de-\\nfined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or \\n(ii) Pesticides as defined in 7 U.S.C. \\n136(u). \\n(2) Examples of food include: Fruits, \\nvegetables, fish, dairy products, eggs, raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food, ani-mal feed (including pet food), food and feed ingredients, food and feed addi-tives, dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, infant formula, beverages (including alcoholic beverages and bot-tled water), live food animals, bakery goods, snack foods, candy, and canned foods. \\nHarvesting applies to farms and farm \\nmixed-type facilities and means activi-ties that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food.

Har-vesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural com-modity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or other-wise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trim-ming part of the raw agricultural com-modity ( e.g., foliage, husks, roots or \\nstems). Examples of harvesting also in-clude cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commod-ities grown on a farm. \\nHolding means storage of food and \\nalso includes activities performed inci-dental to storage of a food ( e.g., activi-\\nties performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigat-ing food during storage, and drying/de-hydrating raw agricultural commod-ities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities per-formed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural com-modity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facili-ties could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks. \\nManufacturing/processing means mak-\\ning food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, in-cluding food crops or ingredients. Ex-amples of manufacturing/processing ac-tivities include: Baking, boiling, bot-tling, canning, cooking, cooling, cut-ting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/de-hydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pas-teurizing, peeling, rendering, treating \\nto manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufac-turing/processing does not include ac-tivities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding. \\nMixed-type facility means an estab-\\nlishment that engages in both activi-ties that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facil-ity is a ‘‘farm mixed-type facility,’’ which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities out-side the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered. \\nNonprofit food establishment means a \\ncharitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establish-ment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. In-ternal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)). \\nPackaging (when used as a verb) \\nmeans placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives. \\nPacking means placing food into a \\ncontainer other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food ( e.g., ac-\\ntivities performed for the safe or effec-tive packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a proc-essed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act. \\nRestaurant means a facility that pre-\\npares and sells food directly to con-sumers for immediate consumption. ‘‘Restaurant’’ does not include facili-ties that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00039 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '29', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The term ‘‘retail food estab-lishment’’ includes facilities that man-ufacture, process, pack, or hold food if the establishment’s primary function is to sell from that establishment food, including food that it manufactures, processes, packs, or holds, directly to consumers. A retail food establish-ment’s primary function is to sell food directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales of food prod-ucts directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value of sales of food products to all other buyers. The term ‘‘consumers’’ does not include busi-nesses. A ‘‘retail food establishment’’ includes grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine locations. A ‘‘retail food establishment’’ also in-cludes certain farm-operated busi-nesses selling food directly to con-sumers as their primary function. \\n(1) Sale of food directly to consumers \\nfrom an establishment located on a farm includes sales by that establish-ment directly to consumers: \\n(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situ-\\nated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers’ market (a loca-tion where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers); \\n(ii) Through a community supported \\nagriculture program. Community sup-ported agriculture (CSA) program means a program under which a farmer or group of farmers grows food for a group of shareholders (or subscribers) who pledge to buy a portion of the farmer’s crop(s) for that season. This includes CSA programs in which a \\ngroup of farmers consolidate their crops at a central location for distribu-tion to shareholders or subscribers; and \\n(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer \\nsales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and Internet order, including online farmers markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs. \\n(2) Sale of food directly to consumers \\nby a farm-operated business includes the sale of food by that farm-operated business directly to consumers: \\n(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situ-\\nated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers’ market (a loca-tion where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers); \\n(ii) Through a community supported \\nagriculture program.

A \\nU.S. agent may not be in the form of a mailbox, answering machine or service, or other place where an individual act-ing as the foreign facility’s agent is not physically present. \\n(1) The U.S. agent acts as a commu-\\nnications link between FDA and the foreign facility for both emergency and routine communications. The U.S. agent will be the person FDA contacts when an emergency occurs, unless the registration specifies another emer-gency contact. \\n(2) FDA will treat representations by \\nthe U.S. agent as those of the foreign facility, and will consider information or documents provided to the U.S. agent the equivalent of providing the information or documents to the for-eign facility. FDA will consider the U.S. agent the equivalent of the reg-istrant for purposes of sharing informa-tion and communications. The U.S. agent of a foreign facility may view the information submitted in the foreign facility’s registration. \\n(3) Having a single U.S. agent for the \\npurposes of this subpart does not pre-clude facilities from having multiple agents (such as foreign suppliers) for other business purposes. A firm’s com-mercial business in the United States need not be conducted through the U.S. agent designated for purposes of this subpart. \\nYou or registrant means the owner, \\noperator, or agent in charge of a facil-ity that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States. \\n[80 FR 56141, Sept. 17, 2015, as amended at 81 \\nFR 3715, Jan. 22, 2016; 81 FR 45950, July 14, 2016] \\nPROCEDURES FOR REGISTRATION OF FOOD \\nFACILITIES  \\n§ 1.230 When must you register or \\nrenew your registration? \\n(a) Registration.

Under section 306 of \\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek de-barment of any person who has been convicted of a felony relating to impor-tation of food into the United States. Failure of an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a domestic or foreign facil-ity to register its facility, renew the registration of its facility, update re-quired elements of its facility’s reg-istration, or cancel its registration in accordance with the requirements of this subpart is a prohibited act under section 301(dd) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n(b) FDA will consider a registration \\nfor a food facility to be expired if the registration is not renewed, as required by §1.230(b). Thus, if you previously submitted a registration to FDA, but do not submit a registration renewal to FDA during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, FDA will consider the registration for the facil-ity to be expired. FDA will consider a food facility with an expired registra-tion to have failed to register in ac-cordance with section 415 of the Fed-eral Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n(c) FDA will cancel a registration if \\nFDA independently verifies that the fa-cility is no longer in business or has changed owners, and the owner, oper-ator, or agent in charge of the facility fails to cancel the registration, or if FDA determines that the registration is for a facility that does not exist, is not required to register, or where the information about the facility’s ad-dress was not updated in a timely man-ner in accordance with §1.234(a) or the registration was submitted by a person not authorized to submit the registra-tion under §1.225. Also, FDA will cancel a registration if the facility’s registra-tion has expired because the facility has failed to renew its registration in accordance with §1.230(b). If FDA can-cels a facility’s registration, FDA will send a confirmation of the cancellation using contact information submitted by the facility in the registration data-base. \\n(d) If an article of food is imported or \\noffered for import into the United States and a foreign facility that man-ufactured/processed, packed, or held that article of food has not registered \\nin accordance with this subpart, the disposition of the article of food shall be governed by the procedures set out in subpart I of this part. \\n[81 FR 45953, July 14, 2016] \\n§ 1.242 What does assignment of a reg-\\nistration number mean? \\nAssignment of a registration number \\nto a facility means that the facility is registered with FDA. Assignment of a registration number does not in any way convey FDA’s approval or endorse-ment of a facility or its products. \\n§ 1.243 Is food registration information \\navailable to the public? \\n(a) The list of registered facilities \\nand registration documents submitted under this subpart are not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Free-dom of Information Act). In addition, any information derived from such list or registration documents that would disclose the identity or location of a specific registered person, is not sub-ject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act). \\n(b) Paragraph (a) of this section does \\nnot apply to any information obtained by other means or that has previously been disclosed to the public as defined in §20.81 of this chapter. \\n§ 1.245 Waiver request. \\nUnder §§1.231(a)(2) and (b), 1.234(d), \\nand 1.235(d), beginning January 4, 2020, you must submit your registration, registration renewal, updates, and can-cellations to FDA electronically unless FDA has granted a waiver from such requirement.

If prior no-\\ntice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but upon review of the notice or examination of the arti-cle of food, the notice is determined to be inaccurate, the food is subject to re-fusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If the article of food is refused due to inaccurate prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is ob-tained for export and the article is im-mediately exported from the port of ar-rival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the ar-ticle unless directed by CBP or FDA. \\n(iii) Untimely prior notice. If prior no-\\ntice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but the full time that applies under §1.279 for prior no-tice has not elapsed when the article of food arrives, the food is subject to re-fusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, unless FDA has al-ready reviewed the prior notice, deter-mined its response to the prior notice, and advised CBP of that response. If the article of food is refused due to un-timely prior notice, unless CBP concur-rence is obtained for export and the ar-ticle is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA. \\n(2) Status and movement of refused \\nfood. (i) An article of food that has \\nbeen refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and paragraph (a) of this sec-tion shall be considered general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490). \\n(ii) Refused food must be moved \\nunder appropriate custodial bond un-less immediately exported under CBP supervision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified of the location where the food is held at that port before the food is moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facil-ity outside the port, FDA must be noti-fied of the location of the secure facil-ity before the food is moved there. The refused food shall not be entered and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a port, the food must be taken \\ndirectly to that secure facility. \\n(3) Segregation of refused foods. If an \\narticle of food that is refused is part of a shipment that contains articles of food that have not been placed under hold or other merchandise not subject to this subpart, the refused article of food may be segregated from the rest of the shipment. This segregation must take place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segrega-tion. If FDA or CBP determines that supervision is necessary, segregation must not take place without super-vision. \\n(4) Costs. Neither FDA nor CBP are \\nliable for transportation, storage, or other expenses resulting from refusal. \\n(5) Export after refusal. An article of \\nfood that has been refused under para-graph (a) of this section may be ex-ported with CBP concurrence and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or administratively detained by FDA or CBP under other authority. If an article of food that has been refused admission under paragraph (a) of this section is exported, the prior notice should be cancelled within 5-business days of exportation. \\n(6) No post-refusal submission or request \\nfor review.

(1) If an \\narticle of food has been refused admis-sion under section 801(m)(1) of the act, a request may be submitted asking FDA to review whether the article is subject to the requirements of this sub-part under §1.277, or whether the infor-mation submitted in a prior notice is complete and accurate. A request for \\nreview may not be used to submit prior notice or to resubmit an inaccurate prior notice. \\n(2) A request may be submitted only \\nby the carrier, submitter, importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. A re-quest must identify which one the re-quester is. \\n(3) A request must be submitted in \\nwriting to FDA and delivered by fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a re-quest is listed at http://www.fda.gov — \\nsee Prior Notice. A request must in-clude all factual and legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its re-view. Only one request for review may be submitted for each refused article. \\n(4) The request must be submitted \\nwithin 5-calendar days of the refusal. FDA will review and respond within 5- calendar days of receiving the request. \\n(5) If FDA determines that the article \\nis not subject to the requirements of this subpart under §1.277 or that the prior notice submission is complete and accurate, it will notify the re-quester, the transmitter, and CBP that the food is no longer subject to refusal \\nunder section 801(m)(1) of the act. \\n(e) International mail. If an article of \\nfood arrives by international mail with inadequate prior notice or the PN con-firmation number is not affixed as re-quired, the parcel will be held by CBP \\nfor 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If FDA refuses the article under section 801(m)(1) of the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked ‘‘No Prior Notice—FDA Refused.’’ If the ar-ticle is refused and there is no return address or FDA determines that the ar-ticle of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender or, if there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense. \\n(f) Prohibitions on delivery and trans-\\nfer.

A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. \\n§ 1.284 What are the other con-\\nsequences of failing to submit ade-quate prior notice or otherwise fail-ing to comply with this subpart? \\n(a) The importing or offering for im-\\nport into the United States of an arti-cle of food in violation of the require-ments of section 801(m) of the act, in-cluding the requirements of this sub-part, is a prohibited act under section 301(ee) of the act (21 U.S.C. 331(ee)). \\n(b) Section 301 of the act prohibits \\nthe doing of certain acts or causing such acts to be done. \\n(1) Under section 302 of the act (21 \\nU.S.C. 332), the United States can bring a civil action in Federal court to en-join persons who commit a prohibited act. \\n(2) Under sections 301 and 303 of the \\nact (21 U.S.C. 331 and 333), the United States can bring a criminal action in Federal court to prosecute persons who are responsible for the commission of a prohibited act. \\n(c) Under section 306 of the act (21 \\nU.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek debarment of any person who has been convicted of a felony relating to importation of food into the United States or any per-son who has engaged in a pattern of importing or offering for import adul-terated food that presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. \\n§ 1.285 What happens to food that is \\nimported or offered for import from unregistered facilities that are re-quired to register under subpart H of this part? \\n(a) Consequences. If an article of food \\nfrom a foreign facility that is not reg-istered as required under section 415 of the act (21 U.S.C. 350d) and subpart H of this part is imported or offered for im-port into the United States, the food is subject to being held under section 801(l) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(l)). (b) Hold. Unless CBP concurrence is \\nobtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival, if an article of food has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless di-rected by CBP or FDA. \\n(c) Status and movement of held food. \\n(1) An article of food that has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act shall be considered general order merchandise as described in sec-tion 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490). \\n(2) Food under hold under section \\n801(l) of the act must be moved under appropriate custodial bond unless im-mediately exported under CBP super-vision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified of the loca-tion where the food is held at the port before the food is moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before the food is moved there. The food subject to hold shall not be en-tered and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate con-signee. If the food is to be held at a se-cure facility outside a port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility. \\n(d) Segregation of held foods. If an arti-\\ncle of food that has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act is part of a shipment that contains arti-cles that have not been placed under hold, the food under hold may be seg-regated from the rest of the shipment. This segregation must take place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segregation. If FDA or CBP determine that supervision is nec-essary, segregation must not take place without supervision. \\n(e) Costs. Neither FDA nor CBP will \\nbe liable for transportation, storage, or other expenses resulting from any hold. \\n(f) Export after hold.

Only one request for review may be submitted for each article under hold. \\n(4) The request must be submitted \\nwithin 5-calendar days of the hold. FDA will review and respond within 5- calendar days of receiving the request. \\n(5) If FDA determines that the article \\nis not from a facility subject to the re-quirements of section 415 of the act, it will notify the requestor and CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act. \\n(k) International mail. If an article of \\nfood that arrives by international mail is from a foreign facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposi-tion. If the article is placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked ‘‘No Reg-istration—No Admission Permitted.’’ If the article is under hold and there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense.

A sec-\\nondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commod-ities, provided that the primary pro-duction farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary ac-tivities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those addi-tional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in para-graphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition. \\nFood has the meaning given in sec-\\ntion 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of food in-clude, but are not limited to fruits; vegetables; fish; dairy products; eggs; raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food; ani-mal feed, including pet food; food and feed ingredients and additives, includ-ing substances that migrate into food from the finished container and other articles that contact food; dietary sup-plements and dietary ingredients; in-fant formula; beverages, including al-coholic beverages and bottled water; live food animals; bakery goods; snack foods; candy; and canned foods. \\nFull-time equivalent employee means \\nall individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. The number of \\nfull-time equivalent employees is de-termined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid di-rectly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks). \\nHarvesting applies to farms and farm \\nmixed-type facilities and means activi-ties that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Har-vesting is limited to activities per-formed on raw agricultural commod-ities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manu-facturing/processing, on a farm. Har-vesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural com-modity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or other-wise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trim-ming part of the raw agricultural com-modity ( e.g., foliage, husks, roots, or \\nstems). Examples of harvesting also in-clude cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commod-ities grown on a farm. \\nHolding means storage of food and \\nalso includes activities performed inci-dental to storage of a food ( e.g., activi-\\nties performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigat-ing food during storage, and drying/de-hydrating raw agricultural commod-ities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities per-formed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural com-modity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Ex-amples of manufacturing/processing ac-tivities include: Baking, boiling, bot-tling, canning, cooking, cooling, cut-ting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/de-hydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pas-teurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufac-turing/processing does not include ac-tivities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding. \\nMixed-type facility means an estab-\\nlishment that engages in both activi-ties that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facil-ity is a ‘‘farm mixed-type facility,’’ which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities out-side the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered. \\nNonprofit food establishment means a \\ncharitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establish-ment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. In-ternal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)). \\nNontransporter means a person who \\nowns food or who holds, manufactures, processes, packs, imports, receives, or distributes food for purposes other \\nthan transportation. \\nNontransporter immediate previous \\nsource means a person that last had food before transferring it to another \\nnontransporter. \\nNontransporter immediate subsequent \\nrecipient means a nontransporter that \\nacquires food from another nontrans-porter. \\nPackaging (when used as a noun) \\nmeans the outer packaging of food that bears the label and does not contact the food. Packaging does not include food contact substances as they are de-fined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \\nPackaging (when used as a verb) \\nmeans placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives. \\nPacking means placing food into a \\ncontainer other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food ( e.g., ac-\\ntivities performed for the safe or effec-tive packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a proc-essed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act. \\nPerson includes individual, partner-\\nship, corporation, and association. \\nRecipe means the formula, including \\ningredients, quantities, and instruc-tions, necessary to manufacture a food product. Because a recipe must have all three elements, a list of the ingredients used to manufacture a product without quantity information and manufac-turing instructions is not a recipe. \\nRestaurant means a facility that pre-\\npares and sells food directly to con-sumers for immediate consumption. ‘‘Restaurant’’ does not include facili-ties that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not pre-pare and serve food directly to con-sumers. \\n(1) Facilities in which food is directly \\nprovided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food es-tablishments, food stands, saloons, tav-erns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00064 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '54', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

For example, the regulations in this subpart are in addition to existing recordkeeping reg-ulations for low acid canned foods, juice, seafood, infant formula, color ad-ditives, bottled water, animal feed, and medicated animal feed. \\n(b) Records established or maintained \\nto satisfy the requirements of this sub-part that meet the definition of elec-tronic records in §11.3(b)(6) (21 CFR 11.3 (b)(6)) of this chapter are exempt from the requirements of part 11 of this chapter. Records that satisfy the re-quirements of this subpart but that are also required under other applicable statutory provisions or regulations re-main subject to part 11 of this chapter. § 1.330 Can existing records satisfy the \\nrequirements of this subpart? \\nThe regulations in this subpart do \\nnot require duplication of existing records if those records contain all of the information required by this sub-part. If a covered person keeps records of all of the information as required by this subpart to comply with other Fed-eral, State, or local regulations, or for any other reason, then those records may be used to meet these require-ments. Moreover, persons do not have to keep all of the information required by this rule in one set of records. If they have records containing some of the required information, they may keep those existing records and keep, either separately or in a combined form, any new information required by this rule. There is no obligation to cre-ate an entirely new record or compila-tion of records containing both exist-ing and new information, even if the records containing some of the re-quired information were not created at the time the food was received or re-leased. \\nR\\nEQUIREMENTS FOR NONTRANSPORTERS  \\nTOESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN RECORDS  \\nTOIDENTIFY THE NONTRANSPORTER  \\nAND TRANSPORTER IMMEDIATE PRE-\\nVIOUS SOURCES OF FOOD \\n§ 1.337 What information must non-\\ntransporters establish and maintain to identify the nontransporter and transporter immediate previous sources of food? \\n(a) If you are a nontransporter, you \\nmust establish and maintain the fol-lowing records for all food you receive: \\n(1) The name of the firm, address, \\ntelephone number and, if available, the fax number and e-mail address of the nontransporter immediate previous source, whether domestic or foreign; \\n(2) An adequate description of the \\ntype of food received, to include brand name and specific variety (e.g., brand x cheddar cheese, not just cheese; or ro-maine lettuce, not just lettuce); \\n(3) The date you received the food; (4) For persons who manufacture, \\nprocess, or pack food, the lot or code number or other identifier of the food \\n(to the extent this information exists); \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00065 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '55', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

You must docu-ment your use of these procedures. \\n(2) You may rely on an entity other \\nthan your foreign supplier to establish the procedures and perform and docu-ment the activities required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section pro-vided that you review and assess that entity’s documentation of the proce-dures and activities, and you document your review and assessment. \\n(b) Foreign supplier verification proce-\\ndures. You must establish and follow \\nadequate written procedures for ensur-ing that appropriate foreign supplier verification activities are conducted with respect to the foods you import. \\n(c) Requirement of supplier verification. \\nThe foreign supplier verification ac-tivities must provide assurance that the hazards requiring a control in the food you import have been signifi-cantly minimized or prevented. \\n(d) Determination of appropriate foreign \\nsupplier verification activities —(1)(i) Gen-\\neral. Except as provided in paragraphs \\n(d)(2) and (3) of this section, before im-porting a food from a foreign supplier, you must determine and document which verification activity or activi-ties listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section, as well as the frequency with which the activity or activities must be conducted, are needed to provide adequate assurances that the food you obtain from the for-eign supplier is produced in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Verification activities must address the entity or entities that are signifi-cantly minimizing or preventing the hazards or verifying that the hazards \\nhave been significantly minimized or prevented ( e.g., when an entity other \\nthan the grower of produce subject to part 112 of this chapter harvests or packs the produce and significantly minimizes or prevents the hazard or verifies that the hazard has been sig-nificantly minimized or prevented, or when the foreign supplier’s raw mate-rial supplier significantly minimizes or prevents a hazard). The determination of appropriate supplier verification ac-tivities must be based on the evalua-tion of the food and foreign supplier conducted under §1.505. \\n(ii) Appropriate verification activities. \\nThe following are appropriate supplier verification activities: \\n(A) Onsite audits as specified in para-\\ngraph (e)(1)(i) of this section; \\n(B) Sampling and testing of a food as \\nspecified in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; \\n(C) Review of the foreign supplier’s \\nrelevant food safety records as speci-fied in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this sec-tion; and \\n(D) Other appropriate supplier \\nverification activities as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section. \\n(2) Verification activities for certain se-\\nrious hazards. When a hazard in a food \\nwill be controlled by the foreign sup-plier and is one for which there is a reasonable probability that exposure to the hazard will result in serious ad-verse health consequences or death to humans or animals, you must conduct or obtain documentation of an onsite audit of the foreign supplier before ini-tially importing the food and at least annually thereafter, unless you make an adequate written determination that, instead of such initial and annual onsite auditing, other supplier verification activities listed in para-graph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and/or less frequent onsite auditing are appro-priate to provide adequate assurances that the foreign supplier is producing the food in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, based on the deter-mination made under §1.505. \\n(3) Reliance on a determination by an-\\nother entity.

(i) Except as speci-\\nfied in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this sec-tion, you may rely on supplier verification activities conducted in ac-cordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section by another entity provided that you review and assess the results of these activities in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. \\n(ii) You may not rely on the foreign \\nsupplier itself or employees of the for-eign supplier to perform supplier verification activities, except with re-spect to sampling and testing of food in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. \\n(3) Review of results of verification ac-\\ntivities. You must promptly review and \\nassess the results of the verification activities that you conduct or obtain documentation of under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or that are con-ducted by other entities in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. You must document your review and assessment of the results of verification activities. If the results do not provide adequate assurances that the hazards requiring a control in the food you obtain from the foreign sup-plier have been significantly minimized or prevented, you must take appro-priate action in accordance with §1.508(a). You are not required to re-tain documentation of supplier verification activities conducted by other entities, provided that you can obtain the documentation and make it available to FDA in accordance with §1.510(b). \\n(4) Independence of qualified individ-\\nuals conducting verification activities. There must not be any financial con-flicts of interests that influence the re-\\nsults of the verification activities set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and payment must not be related to the results of the activity. \\n§ 1.507 What requirements apply when \\nI import a food that cannot be con-sumed without the hazards being controlled or for which the hazards are controlled after importation? \\n(a) Circumstances.

(1) FDA will issue a no-\\ntice of the denial of a recognition re-newal to any third-party certification bodies accredited by the accreditation body whose renewal application was de-nied. The third-party certification body’s accreditation will remain in ef-fect so long as the third-party certifi-cation body: \\n(i) No later than 60 days after FDA’s \\nissuance of the notice of the denial of recognition renewal, conducts a self-as-sessment under §1.655 and reports the results of the self-assessment to FDA under §1.656(b); and \\n(ii) No later than 1 year after \\nissuance of the notice of denial of rec-ognition renewal or the original date of the expiration of the accreditation, whichever comes first, becomes accred-ited by another recognized accredita-tion body or by FDA through direct ac-creditation. \\n(2) FDA may withdraw the accredita-\\ntion of a third-party certification body whenever FDA determines there is good cause for withdrawal of accredita-tion under §1.664(c). \\n(g) Effect of denial of an application for \\nrenewal of recognition of an accreditation body on food or facility certifications issued to eligible entities. A food or facil-\\nity certification issued by a third-party certification body accredited by a rec-ognized accreditation body prior to issuance of a denial of the renewal ap-plication will remain in effect until the certification expires. If FDA has reason to believe that a certification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the certifi-cation in determining the admissibility of the article of food for which the cer-tification was offered or in determining the importer’s eligibility for participa-tion in the voluntary qualified im-porter program (VQIP). \\n(h) Public notice of denial of an appli-\\ncation for renewal of recognition of an ac-creditation body. FDA will provide no-\\ntice on the Web site described in §1.690 of the date of issuance of a denial of a \\nrenewal application and will describe the basis for the denial. \\n§ 1.632 What is the duration of recogni-\\ntion? \\nFDA may grant recognition of an ac-\\ncreditation body for a period not to ex-ceed 5 years from the date of recogni-tion. \\n§ 1.633 How will FDA monitor recog-\\nnized accreditation bodies? \\n(a) FDA will evaluate the perform-\\nance of each recognized accreditation body to determine its compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. Such assessment must occur by at least 4 years after the date of rec-ognition for a 5-year recognition pe-riod, or by no later than the mid-term point for a recognition period of less than 5 years. FDA may conduct addi-tional assessments of a recognized ac-creditation body at any time. \\n(b) An FDA assessment of a recog-\\nnized accreditation body may include onsite assessments of a representative sample of third-party certification bod-ies the recognized accreditation body accredited and onsite audits of a rep-resentative sample of eligible entities certified by such third-party certifi-cation bodies under this subpart. These may be conducted at any time and, as FDA determines necessary or appro-priate, may occur without the recog-nized accreditation body or, in the case of an audit of an eligible entity, the ac-credited third-party certification body present. \\n§ 1.634 When will FDA revoke recogni-\\ntion? \\n(a) Grounds for revocation of recogni-\\ntion. FDA will revoke the recognition \\nof an accreditation body found not to be in compliance with the require-ments of this subpart, including for any one or more of the following: \\n(1) Refusal by the accreditation body \\nto allow FDA to access records re-quired by §1.625, or to conduct an as-sessment or investigation of the ac-creditation body or of a third-party certification body it accredited to en-sure the accreditation body’s continued compliance with the requirements of this subpart. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00103 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '93', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The accred-ited third-party certification body seeking a waiver or waiver extension must demonstrate there is insufficient access to audit agents and any third- \\nparty certification bodies that are comprised of an individual in the coun-try or region where the eligible entity is located. \\n(b) Requests for a waiver or waiver \\nextension and all documents provided in support of the request must be sub-mitted to FDA electronically, in English. The requestor must provide such translation and interpretation services as are needed by FDA to proc-ess the request. \\n(c) The request must be signed by the \\nrequestor or by any individual author-ized to act on behalf of the requestor for purposes of seeking such waiver or waiver extension. \\n(d) FDA will review requests for \\nwaivers and waiver extensions on a first in, first out basis according to the date on which the completed submis-\\nsion is received; however, FDA may prioritize the review of specific re-quests to meet the needs of the pro-gram. FDA will evaluate any com-pleted waiver request to determine whether the criteria for waiver have been met. \\n(e) FDA will notify the requestor \\nwhether the request for a waiver or waiver extension is approved or denied. \\n(f) If FDA approves the request, \\nissuance of the waiver will state the duration of the waiver and list any lim-itations associated with it. If FDA de-nies the request, the issuance of a de-nial of a waiver request will state the basis for denial and will provide the ad-dress and procedures for requesting re-consideration of the request under §1.691. \\n(g) Unless FDA notifies a requestor \\nthat its waiver request has been ap-proved, an accredited third-party cer-tification body must not use the audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of such eligible entity until the 13-month limit in §1.650(c) has elapsed. \\n§ 1.664 When would FDA withdraw ac-\\ncreditation? \\n(a) Mandatory withdrawal.

FDA may waive manda-\\ntory withdrawal under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if FDA: \\n(1) Conducts an investigation of the \\nmaterial facts related to the outbreak of human or animal illness; \\n(2) Reviews the relevant audit \\nrecords and the actions taken by the accredited third-party certification body in support of its decision to cer-tify; and \\n(3) Determines that the accredited \\nthird-party certification body satisfied the requirements for issuance of cer-tification under this subpart. \\n(c) Discretionary withdrawal. FDA \\nmay withdraw accreditation, in whole or in part, from a third-party certifi-cation body when such third-party cer-tification body is accredited by an ac-creditation body for which recognition is revoked under §1.634, if FDA deter-mines there is good cause for with-drawal, including: \\n(1) Demonstrated bias or lack of ob-\\njectivity when conducting activities under this subpart; or \\n(2) Performance that calls into ques-\\ntion the validity or reliability of its food safety audits or certifications. \\n(d) Records access.

A food or facility \\ncertification issued by a third-party certification body prior to withdrawal will remain in effect until the certifi-cation terminates by expiration. If FDA has reason to believe that a cer-tification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the certification in deter-mining the admissibility of the article of food for which the certification was offered or in determining the import-er’s eligibility for participation in VQIP. \\n(g) Effect of withdrawal of accredita-\\ntion on recognized accreditation bodies.

Administrative detention is intended to protect the public by pre-venting distribution or use of drugs en-countered during inspections that may be adulterated or misbranded, until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had time to consider what action it should take concerning the drugs, and to initiate legal action, if appropriate. Drugs that FDA orders detained may not be used, moved, altered, or tam-pered with in any manner by any per-son during the detention period, except as authorized under paragraph (h) of this section, until FDA terminates the detention order under paragraph (j) of this section, or the detention period ex-pires, whichever occurs first. \\n(b) Criteria for ordering detention.

The detention is \\nto be for a reasonable period that may not exceed 20 calendar days after the detention order is issued, unless the FDA Division Director in whose divi-sion the drugs are located determines that a greater period is required to seize the drugs, to institute injunction proceedings, or to evaluate the need for legal action, in which case the Division Director may authorize detention for 10 additional calendar days. The addi-tional 10-calendar-day detention period may be ordered at the time the deten-tion order is issued or at any time thereafter. The entire detention period may not exceed 30 calendar days, ex-cept when the detention period is ex-tended under paragraph (g)(6) of this section.

As soon as the drugs are moved for the purpose in the preceding sentence, the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the de-tention order, or another responsible division office official, of the move-ment of the drugs. As soon as the drugs are put in final form, they must be seg-regated from other drugs, and the indi-vidual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representa-tive who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office offi-cial, of their new location. The drugs put in final form must not be moved further without FDA approval. \\n(3) The FDA representative who \\nissued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, may approve, in writing, the movement of detained drugs for any of the following purposes: \\n(i) To prevent interference with an \\nestablishment’s operations or harm to the drugs; \\n(ii) To destroy the drugs; (iii) To bring the drugs into compli-\\nance; \\n(iv) For any other purpose that the \\nFDA representative who issued the de-tention order, or other responsible divi-sion office official, believes is appro-priate in the case. \\n(4) If an FDA representative approves \\nthe movement of detained drugs under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the de-tained drugs must remain segregated from other drugs and the person re-sponsible for their movement must im-mediately orally notify the official \\nwho approved the movement of the drugs, or another responsible FDA divi-sion office official, of the new location of the detained drugs. \\n(5) Unless otherwise permitted by the \\nFDA representative who is notified of, or who approves, the movement of drugs under this paragraph, the re-quired tags must accompany the drugs during and after movement and must remain with the drugs until FDA ter-minates the detention or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first. \\n(i) Actions involving adulterated or mis-\\nbranded drugs. If FDA determines that \\nthe detained drugs, including any that have been put in final form, are adul-terated or misbranded, or both, it may initiate legal action against the drugs or the responsible individuals, or both, or request that the drugs be destroyed or otherwise brought into compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act under FDA’s supervision. \\n(j) Detention termination. If FDA de-\\ncides to terminate a detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, an FDA representative au-thorized to terminate a detention will issue a detention termination notice releasing the drugs to any person who received the original detention order or that person’s representative and will remove, or authorize in writing the re-moval of, the required labels or tags. \\n(k) Recordkeeping requirements.

Such treated seed, if con-sumed, presents a hazard to humans and livestock. It is not unusual for stocks of such treated food seeds to re-main on hand after the planting season has passed. Despite the cautions re-quired by the Federal Seed Act (53 Stat. 1275, as amended 72 Stat. 476, 7 U.S.C. 1551 et seq. ) in the labeling of the \\ntreated seed, the Food and Drug Ad-ministration has encountered many cases where such surplus stocks of treated wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum seed had been mixed with untreated seed and sent to market for food or feed use. This has resulted in livestock injury and in legal actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-metic Act against large quantities of food adulterated through such admix-ture of poisonous treated seeds with good food. Criminal cases were brought against some firms and individuals. Where the treated seeds are promi-nently colored, buyers and users or processors of agricultural food seed for \\nfood purposes are able to detect the ad-mixture of the poisonous seed and thus reject the lots; but most such buyers, users, and processors do not have the facilities or scientific equipment to de-termine the presence of the poisonous chemical at the time crops are deliv-ered, in cases where the treated seeds have not been so colored. A suitable color for this use is one that is in suffi-cient contrast to the natural color of the food seed as to make admixture of treated, denatured seeds with good food \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00160 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '150', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Such con-tamination has been the result of the original use of these containers for the storage and shipment of articles con-taining or bearing disease organisms or poisonous or deleterious substances. \\n(b) The Commissioner concludes that \\nsuch dangerous or potentially dan-gerous practices include, but are not limited to, the following: \\n(1) Some vegetable growers and pack-\\ners employ used poultry crates for shipment of fresh vegetables, including cabbage and celery. Salmonella orga-nisms are commonly present on dressed poultry and in excreta and fluid exudates from dressed birds. Thus wooden crates in which dressed poultry has been iced and packed are potential sources of Salmonella or other enteropathogenic microorganisms that may contaminate fresh vegetables which are frequently consumed with-\\nout heat treatment. \\n(2) Some potato growers and pro-\\nducers of animal feeds use secondhand bags for shipment of these articles.

Subpart A—Assignment of Agen-\\ncy Component for Review of Premarket Applications \\n§ 3.1 Purpose. \\nThis regulation relates to agency \\nmanagement and organization and has two purposes. The first is to implement section 503(g) of the act, as added by section 16 of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–629) and amended by section 204 of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107–250), by speci-fying how FDA will determine the or-ganizational component within FDA designated to have primary jurisdic-tion for the premarket review and reg-ulation of products that are comprised of any combination of a drug and a de-vice; a device and a biological; a bio-logical and a drug; or a drug, a device and a biological. This determination will eliminate, in most cases, the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for such combina-tion products. The second purpose of this regulation is to enhance the effi-ciency of agency management and op-erations by providing procedures for determining which agency component will have primary jurisdiction for any drug, device, or biological product where such jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. Nothing in this section pre-vents FDA from using any agency re-sources it deems necessary to ensure adequate review of the safety and effec-tiveness of any product, or the substan-tial equivalence of any device to a predicate device. \\n[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 68 \\nFR 37077, June 23, 2003] \\n§ 3.2 Definitions. \\nFor the purpose of this part: \\n(a) Act means the Federal Food, \\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act. \\n(b) Agency component means the Cen-\\nter for Biologics Evaluation and Re-search, the Center for Devices and Ra-diological Health, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or alter-native organizational component of the agency. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00163 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '153', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

I (4–1–22 Edition) § 3.2 \\n(c) Applicant means any person who \\nsubmits or plans to submit an applica-tion to the Food and Drug Administra-tion for premarket review. For pur-poses of this section, the terms ‘‘spon-sor’’ and ‘‘applicant’’ have the same meaning. \\n(d) Biological product has the meaning \\ngiven the term in section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)). \\n(e) Combination product includes: \\n(1) A product comprised of two or \\nmore regulated components, i.e., drug/ device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are phys-ically, chemically, or otherwise com-bined or mixed and produced as a single entity; \\n(2) Two or more separate products \\npackaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug prod-ucts; \\n(3) A drug, device, or biological prod-\\nuct packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of admin-istration, or significant change in dose; or \\n(4) Any investigational drug, device, \\nor biological product packaged sepa-rately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. \\n(f) Device has the meaning given the \\nterm in section 201(h) of the act. \\n(g) Drug has the meaning given the \\nterm in section 201(g)(1) of the act. \\n(h) FDA means Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration. \\n(i) Letter of designation means the \\nwritten notice issued by the product jurisdiction officer specifying the agen-cy component with primary jurisdic-tion for a combination product.

For pur-poses of this definition, ‘‘therapeutic’’ action or effect includes any effect or action of the combination product in-tended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or affect the structure or any function of the body. When making assignments of combina-tion products under this part, the agen-cy will consider three types of mode of action: The actions provided by a bio-logical product, a device, and a drug. Because combination products are comprised of more than one type of regulated article (biological product, device, or drug), and each constituent part contributes a biological product, device, or drug mode of action, com-bination products will typically have more than one identifiable mode of ac-tion. \\n(1) A constituent part has a biologi-\\ncal product mode of action if it acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product applica-ble to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings, as described in section 351(i) of the Public Health Service Act. \\n(2) A constituent part has a device \\nmode of action if it meets the defini-tion of device contained in section 201(h)(1) to (h)(3) of the act, it does not have a biological product mode of ac-tion, and it does not achieve its pri-mary intended purposes through chem-ical action within or on the body of man or other animals and is not de-pendent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. \\n(3) A constituent part has a drug \\nmode of action if it meets the defini-tion of drug contained in section 201(g)(1) of the act and it does not have a biological product or device mode of action. \\n(l) Premarket review includes the ex-\\namination of data and information in an application for premarket review \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00164 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '154', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The most important therapeutic action is the mode of ac-tion expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. \\n(n) Product means any article that \\ncontains any drug as defined in section 201(g)(1) of the act; any device as de-fined in section 201(h) of the act; or any biologic as defined in section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)). \\n(o) Product jurisdiction officer is the \\nperson or persons responsible for desig-nating the component of FDA with pri-mary jurisdiction for the premarket re-view and regulation of a combination product or any product requiring a ju-risdictional designation under this part. \\n(p) Sponsor means ‘‘applicant’’ (see \\n§3.2(c)). \\n[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 64 \\nFR 398, Jan. 5, 1999; 64 FR 56447, Oct. 20, 1999; 68 FR 37077, June 23, 2003; 70 FR 49861, Aug. 25, 2005] \\n§ 3.3 Scope. \\nThis section applies to: \\n(a) Any combination product, or (b) Any product where the agency \\ncomponent with primary jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. \\n§ 3.4 Designated agency component. \\n(a) To designate the agency compo-\\nnent with primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination product, the agency shall determine the primary mode of action of the product. Where the primary mode of action is that of: (1) A drug (other than a biological \\nproduct), the agency component charged with premarket review of drugs shall have primary jurisdiction; \\n(2) A device, the agency component \\ncharged with premarket review of de-\\nvices shall have primary jurisdiction; \\n(3) A biological product, the agency \\ncomponent charged with premarket re-view of biological products shall have primary jurisdiction. \\n(b) In some situations, it is not pos-\\nsible to determine, with reasonable certainty, which one mode of action will provide a greater contribution than any other mode of action to the overall therapeutic effects of the com-bination product. In such a case, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency component that regulates other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. When there are no other combination prod-ucts that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency component with the most expertise related to the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by the combina-tion product. \\n(c) The designation of one agency \\ncomponent as having primary jurisdic-tion for the premarket review and reg-ulation of a combination product does not preclude consultations by that component with other agency compo-nents or, in appropriate cases, the re-quirement by FDA of separate applica-tions. \\n[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 70 \\nFR 49861, Aug. 25, 2005] \\n§ 3.5 Procedures for identifying the \\ndesignated agency component. \\n(a)(1) The Center for Biologics Eval-\\nuation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Re-search have entered into agreements clarifying product jurisdictional issues.

Recall is a voluntary ac-tion that takes place because manufac-turers and distributors carry out their responsibility to protect the public health and well-being from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception or are otherwise defective. This section and §§7.41 through 7.59 rec-ognize the voluntary nature of recall by providing guidance so that respon-sible firms may effectively discharge their recall responsibilities. These sec-tions also recognize that recall is an al-ternative to a Food and Drug Adminis-tration-initiated court action for re-moving or correcting violative, distrib-uted products by setting forth specific recall procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to monitor re-calls and assess the adequacy of a firm’s efforts in recall. \\n(b) Recall may be undertaken volun-\\ntarily and at any time by manufactur-ers and distributors, or at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. A request by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration that a firm recall a prod-uct is reserved for urgent situations and is to be directed to the firm that has primary responsibility for the man-ufacture and marketing of the product that is to be recalled. \\n(c) Recall is generally more appro-\\npriate and affords better protection for consumers than seizure, when many lots of product have been widely dis-tributed. Seizure, multiple seizure, or other court action is indicated when a firm refuses to undertake a recall re-quested by the Food and Drug Adminis-tration, or where the agency has rea-son to believe that a recall would not be effective, determines that a recall is \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00190 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '180', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Any conclusion shall be supported as completely as \\npossible by scientific documentation and/or statements that the conclusion is the opinion of the individual(s) mak-ing the health hazard determination. \\n(3) Assessment of hazard to various \\nsegments of the population, e.g., chil-dren, surgical patients, pets, livestock, etc., who are expected to be exposed to the product being considered, with par-ticular attention paid to the hazard to those individuals who may be at great-est risk. \\n(4) Assessment of the degree of seri-\\nousness of the health hazard to which the populations at risk would be ex-posed. \\n(5) Assessment of the likelihood of \\noccurrence of the hazard. \\n(6) Assessment of the consequences \\n(immediate or long-range) of occur-rence of the hazard. \\n(b) On the basis of this determina-\\ntion, the Food and Drug Administra-tion will assign the recall a classifica-tion, i.e., Class I, Class II, or Class III, to indicate the relative degree of health hazard of the product being re-called or considered for recall. \\n§ 7.42 Recall strategy. \\n(a) General. (1) A recall strategy that \\ntakes into account the following fac-tors will be developed by the agency for a Food and Drug Administration-re-quested recall and by the recalling firm for a firm-initiated recall to suit the individual circumstances of the par-\\nticular recall: \\n(i) Results of health hazard evalua-\\ntion. \\n(ii) Ease in identifying the product. (iii) Degree to which the product’s \\ndeficiency is obvious to the consumer or user. \\n(iv) Degree to which the product re-\\nmains unused in the market-place. \\n(v) Continued availability of essen-\\ntial products. \\n(2) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion will review the adequacy of a pro-posed recall strategy developed by a re-calling firm and recommend changes as appropriate. A recalling firm should conduct the recall in accordance with an approved recall strategy but need not delay initiation of a recall pending review of its recall strategy. \\n(b) Elements of a recall strategy. A re-\\ncall strategy will address the following elements regarding the conduct of the recall: \\n(1) Depth of recall. Depending on the \\nproduct’s degree of hazard and extent of distribution, the recall strategy will specify the level in the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend, as follows: \\n(i) Consumer or user level, which \\nmay vary with product, including any intermediate wholesale or retail level; or \\n(ii) Retail level, including any inter-\\nmediate wholesale level; or \\n(iii) Wholesale level. (2) Public warning. The purpose of a \\npublic warning is to alert the public that a product being recalled presents a serious hazard to health. It is re-served for urgent situations where other means for preventing use of the recalled product appear inadequate. The Food and Drug Administration in consultation with the recalling firm will ordinarily issue such publicity. The recalling firm that decides to issue its own public warning is requested to submit its proposed public warning and plan for distribution of the warning for review and comment by the Food and \\nDrug Administration. The recall strat-egy will specify whether a public warn-ing is needed and whether it will issue as: \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00191 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '181', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The purpose of \\neffectiveness checks is to verify that all consignees at the recall depth speci-fied by the strategy have received noti-fication about the recall and have taken appropriate action. The method for contacting consignees may be ac-complished by personal visits, tele-phone calls, letters, or a combination thereof. A guide entitled ‘‘Methods for Conducting Recall Effectiveness Checks’’ that describes the use of these different methods is available upon re-quest from the Division of Dockets Management (HFA–305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The recalling firm will ordinarily be responsible for conducting effectiveness checks, but the Food and Drug Administration will assist in this task where necessary and appropriate. The recall strategy will specify the method(s) to be used for and the level of effectiveness checks that will be conducted, as follows: \\n(i) Level A—100 percent of the total \\nnumber of consignees to be contacted; \\n(ii) Level B—Some percentage of the \\ntotal number of consignees to be con-tacted, which percentage is to be deter-mined on a case-by-case basis, but is greater that 10 percent and less than 100 percent of the total number of con-signees; \\n(iii) Level C—10 percent of the total \\nnumber of consignees to be contacted; \\n(iv) Level D—2 percent of the total \\nnumber of consignees to be contacted; or \\n(v) Level E—No effectiveness checks. \\n[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 46 \\nFR 8455, Jan. 27, 1981; 59 FR 14363, Mar. 28, 1994; 68 FR 24879, May 9, 2003] \\n§ 7.45 Food and Drug Administration- \\nrequested recall. \\n(a) The Commissioner of Food and \\nDrugs or designee may request a firm to initiate a recall when the following determinations have been made: (1) That a product that has been dis-\\ntributed presents a risk of illness or in-jury or gross consumer deception. \\n(2) That the firm has not initiated a \\nrecall of the product. \\n(3) That an agency action is nec-\\nessary to protect the public health and welfare. \\n(b) The Commissioner or his designee \\nwill notify the firm of this determina-tion and of the need to begin imme-diately a recall of the product. Such notification will be by letter or tele-gram to a responsible official of the firm, but may be preceded by oral com-munication or by a visit from an au-thorized representative of the local Food and Drug Administration district office, with formal, written confirma-tion from the Commissioner or his des-ignee afterward. The notification will specify the violation, the health hazard classification of the violative product, the recall strategy, and other appro-priate instructions for conducting the recall. \\n(c) Upon receipt of a request to re-\\ncall, the firm may be asked to provide the Food and Drug Administration any or all of the information listed in §7.46(a). The firm, upon agreeing to the recall request, may also provide other information relevant to the agency’s determination of the need for the re-call or how the recall should be con-ducted. \\n[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 69 \\nFR 17290, Apr. 2, 2004] \\n§ 7.46 Firm-initiated recall. \\n(a) A firm may decide of its own voli-\\ntion and under any circumstances to remove or correct a distributed prod-uct. A firm that does so because it be-lieves the product to be violative is re-quested to notify immediately the ap-propriate Food and Drug Administra-tion district office listed in §5.115 of this chapter. Such removal or correc-tion will be considered a recall only if the Food and Drug Administration re-gards the product as involving a viola-tion that is subject to legal action, e.g., seizure. In such cases, the firm will be asked to provide the Food and Drug Administration the following in-formation: \\n(1) Identity of the product involved. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00192 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '182', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Pending this review, the firm need not delay initiation of its product removal or correction. \\n(c) A firm may decide to recall a \\nproduct when informed by the Food and Drug Administration that the agency has determined that the prod-uct in question violates the law, but the agency has not specifically re-quested a recall. The firm’s action also is considered a firm-initiated recall and is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. \\n(d) A firm that initiates a removal or \\ncorrection of its product which the firm believes is a market withdrawal should consult with the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office when the reason for the removal or correction is not obvious or clearly understood but where it is apparent, e.g., because of complaints or adverse reactions regarding the product, that the product is deficient in some re-spect. In such cases, the Food and Drug Administration will assist the firm in determining the exact nature of the \\nproblem. \\n§ 7.49 Recall communications. \\n(a) General. A recalling firm is re-\\nsponsible for promptly notifying each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format, content, and ex-tent of a recall communication should be commensurate with the hazard of the product being recalled and the strategy developed for that recall. In general terms, the purpose of a recall communication is to convey: \\n(1) That the product in question is \\nsubject to a recall. \\n(2) That further distribution or use of \\nany remaining product should cease immediately. \\n(3) Where appropriate, that the direct \\naccount should in turn notify its cus-tomers who received the product about the recall. \\n(4) Instructions regarding what to do \\nwith the product. \\n(b) Implementation. A recall commu-\\nnication can be accomplished by tele-grams, mailgrams, or first class letters conspicuously marked, preferably in bold red type, on the letter and the en-velope: ‘‘\\nDRUG [or FOOD , BIOLOGIC , etc.] \\nRECALL [or CORRECTION ]’’. The letter \\nand the envelope should be also marked: ‘‘\\nURGENT ’’ for class I and class \\nII recalls and, when appropriate, for class III recalls. Telephone calls or other personal contacts should ordi-narily be confirmed by one of the above methods and/or documented in an ap-propriate manner. \\n(c) Contents. (1) A recall communica-\\ntion should be written in accordance with the following guidelines: \\n(i) Be brief and to the point; (ii) Identify clearly the product, size, \\nlot number(s), code(s) or serial num-ber(s) and any other pertinent descrip-tive information to enable accurate and immediate identification of the product; \\n(iii) Explain concisely the reason for \\nthe recall and the hazard involved, if any; \\n(iv) Provide specific instructions on \\nwhat should be done with respect to the recalled products; and \\n(v) Provide a ready means for the re-\\ncipient of the communication to report to the recalling firm whether it has \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00193 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '183', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Notwithstanding similar spe-cific requirements for certain products in other parts of this chapter, the fol-lowing is provided by the Food and Drug Administration as guidance for a firm’s consideration: \\n(a) Prepare and maintain a current \\nwritten contingency plan for use in ini-tiating and effecting a recall in accord-ance with §§7.40 through 7.49, 7.53, and 7.55. \\n(b) Use sufficient coding of regulated \\nproducts to make possible positive lot identification and to facilitate effec-tive recall of all violative lots. \\n(c) Maintain such product distribu-\\ntion records as are necessary to facili-\\ntate location of products that are being recalled.

The request is submitted under §10.35 but should be headed ‘‘REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF COMMENT PE-RIOD.’’ \\n(i) A request must discuss the reason \\ncomments could not feasibly be sub-mitted within the time permitted, or that important new information will shortly be available, or that sound pub-lic policy otherwise supports an exten-sion of the time for comment. The \\nCommissioner may grant or deny the request or may grant an extension for a time period different from that re-quested. An extension may be limited to specific persons who have made and justified the request, but will ordi-narily apply to all interested persons. \\n(ii) A comment time extension of 30 \\ndays or longer will be published in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER and will be applica-\\nble to all interested persons. A com-ment time extension of less than 30 days will be the subject either of a let-ter or memorandum filed with the Di-vision of Dockets Management or of a notice published in the F\\nEDERAL REG-\\nISTER . (4) A notice of proposed rulemaking \\nwill request that four copies of all com-ments be submitted to the Division of Dockets Management, except that indi-viduals may submit single copies. Com-ments will be stamped with the date of receipt and will be numbered chrono-logically. \\n(5) Persons submitting comments \\ncritical of a proposed regulation are encouraged to include their preferred alternative wording. \\n(c) After the time for comment on a \\nproposed regulation has expired, the Commissioner will review the entire administrative record on the matter, including all comments and, in a no-tice published in the F\\nEDERAL REG-\\nISTER , will terminate the proceeding, \\nissue a new proposal, or promulgate a final regulation. \\n(1) The quality and persuasiveness of \\nthe comments will be the basis for the Commissioner’s decision. The number or length of comments will not ordi-narily be a significant factor in the de-cision unless the number of comments is material where the degree of public interest is a legitimate factor for con-sideration. \\n(2) The decision of the Commissioner \\non the matter will be based solely upon the administrative record. \\n(3) A final regulation published in the \\nF\\nEDERAL REGISTER will have a pre-\\namble stating: (i) The name of the agency, (ii) the nature of the action e.g., final rule, notice, (iii) a summary first paragraph describing the sub-stance of the document in easily under-standable terms, (iv) relevant dates, e.g., the rule’s effective date and com-ment closing date, if an opportunity for comment is provided, (v) the name, business address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can pro-vide further information to the public about the notice, (vi) an address for the submission of written comments when they are permitted, (vii) supple-mentary information about the regula-tion in the body of the preamble that contains references to prior notices re-lating to the same matter and a sum-mary of each type of comment sub-mitted on the proposal and the Com-\\nmissioner’s conclusions with respect to each.

(e) An interested person may request \\njudicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner in the courts without first petitioning the Commissioner for reconsideration or for a stay of action, except that in accordance with para-graph (c) of this section, the person shall request a stay by the Commis-sioner under §10.35 before requesting a stay by the court. \\n(f) The Commissioner shall take the \\nposition in an action for judicial re-view under 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq., whether \\nor not it includes a request for a de-claratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. 2201, or in any other case in which the validity of administrative action is properly challenged, that the validity of the action must be determined sole-ly on the basis of the administrative record specified in §§10.30(i), 10.33(k), 10.35(h), 10.40(g), and 16.80(a) or the ad-ministrative record applicable to any decision or action under the regula-tions referenced in §16.1(b), and that additional information or views may not be considered.

FDA will oppose the admission in evidence of settlement information in a court proceeding or in another ad-ministrative proceeding. \\n§ 10.115 Good guidance practices. \\n(a) What are good guidance practices? \\nGood guidance practices (GGP’s) are FDA’s policies and procedures for de-veloping, issuing, and using guidance documents. \\n(b) What is a guidance document? (1) \\nGuidance documents are documents prepared for FDA staff, applicants/ sponsors, and the public that describe \\nthe agency’s interpretation of or policy on a regulatory issue. \\n(2) Guidance documents include, but \\nare not limited to, documents that re-late to: The design, production, label-ing, promotion, manufacturing, and testing of regulated products; the proc-essing, content, and evaluation or ap-proval of submissions; and inspection and enforcement policies. \\n(3) Guidance documents do not in-\\nclude: Documents relating to internal FDA procedures, agency reports, gen-eral information documents provided to consumers or health professionals, speeches, journal articles and edi-torials, media interviews, press mate-rials, warning letters, memoranda of understanding, or other communica-tions directed to individual persons or firms. \\n(c) What other terms have a special \\nmeaning? (1) ‘‘Level 1 guidance docu-\\nments’’ include guidance documents that: \\n(i) Set forth initial interpretations of \\nstatutory or regulatory requirements; \\n(ii) Set forth changes in interpreta-\\ntion or policy that are of more than a minor nature; \\n(iii) Include complex scientific issues; \\nor \\n(iv) Cover highly controversial \\nissues. \\n(2) ‘‘Level 2 guidance documents’’ are \\nguidance documents that set forth ex-isting practices or minor changes in in-terpretation or policy. Level 2 guidance documents include all guidance docu-ments that are not classified as Level 1. \\n(3) ‘‘You’’ refers to all affected par-\\nties outside of FDA. \\n(d) Are you or FDA required to follow a \\nguidance document? (1) No. Guidance \\ndocuments do not establish legally en-forceable rights or responsibilities. They do not legally bind the public or FDA. \\n(2) You may choose to use an ap-\\nproach other than the one set forth in a guidance document. However, your alternative approach must comply with the relevant statutes and regulations. FDA is willing to discuss an alter-native approach with you to ensure that it complies with the relevant stat-utes and regulations. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00227 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '217', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='218 21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–22 Edition) § 10.115 \\n(3) Although guidance documents do \\nnot legally bind FDA, they represent the agency’s current thinking. There-fore, FDA employees may depart from guidance documents only with appro-priate justification and supervisory concurrence. \\n(e) Can FDA use means other than a \\nguidance document to communicate new agency policy or a new regulatory ap-proach to a broad public audience? The \\nagency may not use documents or other means of communication that are excluded from the definition of guidance document to informally com-municate new or different regulatory expectations to a broad public audience for the first time. These GGP’s must be followed whenever regulatory expecta-tions that are not readily apparent from the statute or regulations are first communicated to a broad public audience. \\n(f) How can you participate in the de-\\nvelopment and issuance of guidance docu-ments? (1) You can provide input on \\nguidance documents that FDA is devel-oping under the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this section. \\n(2) You can suggest areas for guid-\\nance document development. Your sug-gestions should address why a guidance document is necessary. \\n(3) You can submit drafts of proposed \\nguidance documents for FDA to con-sider. When you do so, you should mark the document ‘‘Guidance Docu-ment Submission’’ and submit it to Di-vision of Dockets Management (HFA– 305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rock-ville, MD 20852. If you wish to submit the draft of a proposed guidance docu-ment electronically, submit it through https://www.regulations.gov at Docket \\nNo. FDA–2013–S–0610. It is only nec-essary to submit one copy. \\n(4) You can, at any time, suggest that \\nFDA revise or withdraw an already ex-isting guidance document. Your sug-gestion should address why the guid-ance document should be revised or withdrawn and, if applicable, how it should be revised. \\n(5) Once a year, FDA will publish, \\nboth in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER and on \\nthe Internet, a list of possible topics for future guidance document develop-ment or revision during the next year. You can comment on this list (e.g., by suggesting alternatives or making rec-\\nommendations on the topics that FDA is considering). \\n(6) To participate in the development \\nand issuance of guidance documents through one of the mechanisms de-scribed in paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), or (f)(4) of this section, you should con-tact the center or office that is respon-sible for the regulatory activity cov-ered by the guidance document. \\n(7) If FDA agrees to draft or revise a \\nguidance document, under a suggestion made under paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section, you can participate in the development of that guidance document under the proce-dures described in paragraph (g) of this section. \\n(g) What are FDA’s procedures for de-\\nveloping and issuing guidance documents? (1) FDA’s procedures for the develop-ment and issuance of Level 1 guidance documents are as follows: \\n(i) Before FDA prepares a draft of a \\nLevel 1 guidance document, FDA can seek or accept early input from indi-viduals or groups outside the agency. For example, FDA can do this by par-ticipating in or holding public meet-ings and workshops. \\n(ii) After FDA prepares a draft of a \\nLevel 1 guidance document, FDA will: \\n(A) Publish a notice in the F\\nEDERAL  \\nREGISTER announcing that the draft \\nguidance document is available; \\n(B) Post the draft guidance document \\non the Internet and make it available in hard copy; and \\n(C) Invite your comment on the draft \\nguidance document. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments. \\n(iii) After FDA prepares a draft of a \\nLevel 1 guidance document, FDA also can: \\n(A) Hold public meetings or work-\\nshops; or \\n(B) Present the draft guidance docu-\\nment to an advisory committee for re-view. \\n(iv) After providing an opportunity \\nfor public comment on a Level 1 guid-ance document, FDA will: \\n(A) Review any comments received \\nand prepare the final version of the guidance document that incorporates suggested changes, when appropriate; \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00228 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '218', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

If a version is revised, the new version will be placed on the Internet. \\n(5) You can comment on any guid-\\nance document at any time. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to sub-mit your comments. FDA will revise guidance documents in response to your comments when appropriate. \\n(h) How should you submit comments \\non a guidance document? (1) If you \\nchoose to submit comments on any guidance document under paragraph (g) of this section, you must send them to the Division of Dockets Management (HFA–305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. \\n(2) Comments should identify the \\ndocket number on the guidance docu-ment, if such a docket number exists. For documents without a docket num-ber, the title of the guidance document should be included. \\n(3) Comments will be available to the \\npublic in accordance with FDA’s regu-lations on submission of documents to the Division of Dockets Management specified in §10.20(j). \\n(i) What standard elements must FDA \\ninclude in a guidance document? (1) A \\nguidance document must: \\n(i) Include the term ‘‘guidance,’’ (ii) Identify the center(s) or office(s) \\nissuing the document, \\n(iii) Identify the activity to which \\nand the people to whom the document applies, \\n(iv) Prominently display a statement \\nof the document’s nonbinding effect, \\n(v) Include the date of issuance, (vi) Note if it is a revision to a pre-\\nviously issued guidance and identify the document that it replaces, and \\n(vii) Contain the word ‘‘draft’’ if the \\ndocument is a draft guidance. \\n(2) Guidance documents must not in-\\nclude mandatory language such as ‘‘shall,’’ ‘‘must,’’ ‘‘required,’’ or ‘‘re-quirement,’’ unless FDA is using these words to describe a statutory or regu-latory requirement. \\n(3) When issuing draft guidance docu-\\nments that are the product of inter-national negotiations (e.g., guidances resulting from the International Con-ference on Harmonisation), FDA need \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00229 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '219', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

However, any final guid-ance document issued according to this provision must contain the elements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this sec-tion. \\n(j) Who, within FDA, can approve \\nissuance of guidance documents? Each \\ncenter and office must have written procedures for the approval of guidance documents. Those procedures must en-sure that issuance of all documents is approved by appropriate senior FDA of-ficials. \\n(k) How will FDA review and revise ex-\\nisting guidance documents? (1) The agen-\\ncy will periodically review existing guidance documents to determine whether they need to be changed or withdrawn. \\n(2) When significant changes are \\nmade to the statute or regulations, the agency will review and, if appropriate, revise guidance documents relating to that changed statute or regulation. \\n(3) As discussed in paragraph (f)(3) of \\nthis section, you may at any time sug-gest that FDA revise a guidance docu-ment. \\n(l) How will FDA ensure that FDA staff \\nare following GGP’s? (1) All current and \\nnew FDA employees involved in the de-velopment, issuance, or application of guidance documents will be trained re-garding the agency’s GGP’s. \\n(2) FDA centers and offices will mon-\\nitor the development and issuance of guidance documents to ensure that GGP’s are being followed. \\n(m) How can you get copies of FDA’s \\nguidance documents? FDA will make \\ncopies available in hard copy and, as feasible, through the Internet. \\n(n) How will FDA keep you informed of \\nthe guidance documents that are avail-able? (1) FDA will maintain on the \\nInternet a current list of all guidance documents. New documents will be added to this list within 30 days of issuance. \\n(2) Once a year, FDA will publish in \\nthe F\\nEDERAL REGISTER its comprehen-\\nsive list of guidance documents. The comprehensive list will identify docu-ments that have been added to the list or withdrawn from the list since the previous comprehensive list. \\n(3) FDA’s guidance document lists \\nwill include the name of the guidance document, issuance and revision dates, \\nand information on how to obtain cop-ies of the document. \\n(o) What can you do if you believe that \\nsomeone at FDA is not following these GGP’s? If you believe that someone at \\nFDA did not follow the procedures in this section or that someone at FDA \\ntreated a guidance document as a bind-ing requirement, you should contact that person’s supervisor in the center or office that issued the guidance docu-ment. If the issue cannot be resolved, you should contact the next highest su-pervisor. You can also contact the cen-ter or office ombudsman for assistance in resolving the issue. If you are unable to resolve the issue at the center or of-fice level or if you feel that you are not making progress by going through the chain of command, you may ask the Office of the Chief Mediator and Om-budsman to become involved. \\n[65 FR 56477, Sept. 19, 2000, as amended at 83 \\nFR 13416, Mar. 29, 2018] \\nSubpart C—Electronic Media Cov-\\nerage of Public Administrative Proceedings; Guideline on Policy and Procedures \\nSOURCE : 49 FR 14726, Apr. 13, 1984, unless \\notherwise noted. \\n§ 10.200 Scope. \\nThis guideline describes FDA’s policy \\nand procedures applicable to electronic media coverage of agency public ad-ministrative proceedings.

In many instances FDA has sought to make the open portions of agency public administrative pro-ceedings more accessible to public par-ticipation. Similarly, FDA has sought, wherever possible, to allow full written media access to its proceedings, so that members of the press would have the opportunity to provide first-hand re-ports. However, because electronic media coverage presents certain dif-\\nficulties that are easier to resolve with advance notice to the agency and all participants, FDA believes that codi-fication of its policy will facilitate and further increase media access to its public administrative proceedings. The agency intends to refer to this guide-line when notices of hearing, or indi-vidual advisory committee meetings, are published in the F\\nEDERAL REG-\\nISTER . Thus, all parties to a proceeding \\nwill be on notice that the proceeding may be recorded electronically and any person interested in videotaping or otherwise recording the proceeding will be notified that there are established procedures to be followed. \\n(b) The designated presiding officer \\nof a public administrative proceeding retains the existing discretionary au-thority set forth in specific regulations pertaining to each type of administra-tive proceeding to regulate the conduct of the proceeding over which he or she presides. The responsibilities of the \\npresiding officer, established elsewhere in parts 10 through 16, include an obli-gation to be concerned with the timely conduct of a hearing, the limited avail-ability of certain witnesses, and reduc-ing disruptions to the proceeding which may occur. Each proceeding varies, and the presiding officer cannot anticipate all that might occur. Discretionary au-thority to regulate conduct at a pro-ceeding has traditionally been granted to presiding officers to enable them to fulfill their responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly hearing conducted in an expeditious manner. \\n(c) This guideline provides the pre-\\nsiding officer with a degree of flexi-bility in that it sets forth the agency’s policy as well as the procedures that presiding officers should ordinarily fol-low, but from which they may depart in particular situations if necessary, subject to the presumption of openness of public proceedings to electronic media coverage. The presiding officer’s discretion to establish additional pro-cedures or to limit electronic coverage is to be exercised only in the unusual circumstances defined in this guide-line. Even though a presiding officer may establish additional procedures or limits as may be required in a par-ticular situation, he or she will be guided by the policy expressed in this guideline in establishing these condi-tions. The presiding officer may also be less restrictive, taking into account such factors as the duration of a hear-ing and the design of the room. \\n(d) If a portion or all of a proceeding \\nis closed to the public because material is to be discussed that is not disclosable to the public under applica-ble laws, the proceeding also will be closed to electronic media coverage. \\n(e) The agency requests advance no-\\ntice of intent to record a proceeding electronically to facilitate the orderly conduct of the proceeding. Knowledge of anticipated media coverage will allow the presiding officer to make any special arrangements required by the circumstances of the proceeding. The agency believes that this guideline es-tablishes sufficiently specific criteria to promote uniformity. \\n(f) The agency would like to allow all \\ninterested media representatives to \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00231 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '221', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

However, should space limitations preclude a multitude of cameras, the presiding officer may require pool sharing. In such a case, pool sharing arrangements of the re-sulting videotape should be made be-tween those allowed to film and those who were excluded. Arrangements for who is designated to present the pool and a method of distributing the re-sulting film or tape may be determined by the established networks’ pooling system. However, the agency has a strong commitment to ensuring that media representatives other than the major networks also be able to obtain a copy of the tape at cost. FDA is con-cerned that if the network pool rep-resentative wishes to record only a short portion of a proceeding, but an excluded party wishes to record the en-tire proceeding, confusion will result. The agency expects the interested media representatives to negotiate a suitable agreement among themselves before commencement of the pro-ceeding. For example, the network pool representatives might agree to record a portion of the proceeding up to a break in the proceeding, at which time, while the network representative is dis-assembling equipment, another media representative might set up to con-tinue recording. If an agreement can-not be reached before the proceeding, the agency will use the time of receipt of any advance notice to determine the representation for each category of media, e.g., one network reporter, one independent reporter. The agency rec-ommends that parties intending to vid-eotape provide as much advance notice as possible, so that the agency may best respond to the needs of the elec-tronic media. \\n(g) To ensure the timely conduct of \\nagency hearings and to prevent disrup-tions, equipment is to be stationary during a proceeding and should be set up and taken down when the pro-ceeding is not in progress. As noted previously, the presiding officer may, at his or her discretion, be less restric-tive if appropriate. \\n(h) The agency recognizes that elec-\\ntronic media representatives may de-sire only short footage of a proceeding, a facsimile of the proceeding, and/or interview opportunities and may be un-\\nnecessarily restricted by requirements for setting up before a proceeding and then waiting until a break in the pro-\\nceeding before being permitted to take down their equipment. To accommo-date this possibility, FDA’s Press Rela-tions Staff will attempt to make ar-rangements to respond to such needs by, for example, requesting that the presiding officer provide a break short-ly after commencement of the pro-ceeding to permit take down of equip-ment. \\n(i) The agency is making a full com-\\nmitment to allowing, whenever pos-sible, electronic coverage of its public administrative proceedings subject to the limited restrictions established in this guideline. \\n§ 10.205 Electronic media coverage of \\npublic administrative proceedings. \\n(a) A person may record electroni-\\ncally any open public administrative proceeding, subject to the procedures specified in this guideline. The proce-dures include a presumption that agen-cy public proceedings are open to the electronic media. Whenever possible, FDA will permit all interested persons access to record agency public adminis-trative proceedings. Restrictions other than those listed in §10.206 will be im-posed only under exceptional cir-cumstances. \\n(b) A videotape recording of an FDA \\npublic administrative proceeding is not an official record of the proceeding. The only official record is the written transcript of the proceeding, which is taken by the official reporter. \\n§ 10.206 Procedures for electronic \\nmedia coverage of agency public administrative proceedings. \\n(a) To facilitate the agency’s re-\\nsponse to media needs, a person intend-ing to videotape an FDA public admin-istrative proceeding should, whenever possible, provide advance notice to the Press Relations Staff (HFI–20), Office of Public Affairs, Food and Drug Adminis-tration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, in writing or by telephone (telephone 301–443–4177), at least 48 hours in advance of the proceeding.

If so, the Press Relations Staff will function as a liaison between the presiding officer and the person intend-ing to record the proceeding in facili-tating any procedures in addition to those outlined in this subpart. The pre-siding officer will not deny access for failure to provide a 48-hour advance no-tice. Any advance notice may describe the intended length of recording if known, the amount and type of equip-ment to be used, and any special needs such as interviews. \\n(b) Cameras should be completely set \\nup before a proceeding is scheduled to begin or during a break in the pro-ceeding and should remain standing in the area designated for electronic media equipment. Cameras may be taken down only during breaks or after the hearing is over. Roving cameras will not be permitted during the pro-ceeding. Any artificial lighting should be unobtrusive. Microphones, like cam-eras, should be in place before the start of a proceeding and may be taken down as indicated in this paragraph. \\n(c) When space in the hearing room is \\nlimited, the presiding officer may re-strict the number of cameras or the equipment present. Should such a re-striction become necessary, the pool arrangements are the responsibility of the participating media. The agency encourages the network pool to make copies of the tape, film, or other prod-uct available at cost to nonpool par-ticipants. However, if this is not pos-sible, the agency may need to use the time of receipt of any advance notice to determine the representation for each category, e.g., one network re-porter, one independent reporter, etc. \\n(d) Off the record portions of a pro-\\nceeding may not be videotaped. \\n(e) Before or during the proceeding, \\nthe presiding officer may establish other conditions specific to the pro-ceeding for which the request is being made. These conditions may be more or less restrictive than those stated in this guideline, except that the pre-siding officer shall observe the agen-cy’s presumption of openness of its \\npublic proceedings to the electronic media. Only a substantial and clear threat to the agency’s interests in order, fairness, and timeliness author-izes the presiding officer to impose ad-ditional restrictions. This threat must outweigh the public interest in elec-tronic media coverage of agency pro-ceedings. Additional restrictions shall be narrowly drawn to the particular circumstances. The following factors are listed to assist presiding officers in determining whether the agency’s in-terest is sufficiently compelling to call for the unusual step of imposing addi-tional restrictions. Generally this step is justified when one of the following factors is met: \\n(1) Electronic recording would result \\nin a substantial likelihood of disrup-tion that clearly cannot be contained by the procedures established in para-graphs (a) through (d) of this section. \\n(2) Electronic recording would result \\nin a substantial likelihood of preju-dicial impact on the fairness of the pro-ceeding or the substantive discussion in a proceeding. \\n(3) There is a substantial likelihood \\nthat a witness’ ability to testify may be impaired due to unique personal cir-cumstances such as the age or psycho-logical state of the witness or the par-ticularly personal or private nature of the witness’ testimony, if the witness’ testimony were electronically re-corded. \\n(f) Before the proceeding, the Press \\nRelations Staff will, upon request, pro-vide written copies of any additional conditions imposed by the presiding of-ficer (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) to requesting members of the media.

The presiding of-\\nficer shall exercise his or her discretion to restrict or discontinue electronic coverage of a public proceeding, or por-tions of a public proceeding, only if he or she determines that the agency’s in-terest in the fair and orderly adminis-trative process is substantially threat-ened. A clear and substantial threat to the integrity of agency proceedings must clearly outweigh the public inter-est in electronic media coverage of the proceedings before additional restric-tions are imposed on the electronic media during the course of the pro-ceedings. The factors noted in para-graph (e) of this section indicate the kind of substantial threat to the agen-cy interests that may require imposing additional restrictions during the course of the proceedings. If additional requirements are established during the hearing, the presiding officer shall notify immediately the Deputy Com-missioner of Food and Drugs of that fact by telephone and submit a written explanation of the circumstances that \\nnecessitated such an action within 24 hours or sooner if requested by the Deputy Commissioner. In the absence or unavailability of the Deputy Com-missioner, the presiding officer shall notify the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. \\n(h) A decision by a presiding officer, \\nmade either before the proceeding or during the course of a proceeding, to establish requirements in addition to the minimum standards set forth in this guideline may be appealed by any adversely affected person who intends to record the proceeding electronically. Appeals may be made in writing or by phone to the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, to the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. The filing of an appeal, whether before or during a proceeding, does not re-quire the presiding officer to interrupt the proceeding. However, the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, the Associate Commissioner for Regu-latory Affairs will resolve an appeal as expeditiously as possible so as to pre-serve, to the extent possible, the re-porters’ opportunity to record the pro-ceedings. \\n[49 FR 14726, Apr. 13, 1984, as amended at 54 \\nFR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989] PART 11—ELECTRONIC RECORDS; \\nELECTRONIC SIGNATURES \\nSubpart A—General Provisions \\nSec. \\n11.1 Scope. 11.2 Implementation. 11.3 Definitions. \\nSubpart B—Electronic Records \\n11.10 Controls for closed systems. 11.30 Controls for open systems. 11.50 Signature manifestations. \\n11.70 Signature/record linking. \\nSubpart C—Electronic Signatures \\n11.100 General requirements. 11.200 Electronic signature components and \\ncontrols. \\n11.300 Controls for identification codes/pass-\\nwords. \\nA\\nUTHORITY : 21 U.S.C. 321–393; 42 U.S.C. 262. \\nSOURCE : 62 FR 13464, Mar. 20, 1997, unless \\notherwise noted. \\nSubpart A—General Provisions \\n§ 11.1 Scope. \\n(a) The regulations in this part set \\nforth the criteria under which the agency considers electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records to be trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper. \\n(b) This part applies to records in \\nelectronic form that are created, modi-fied, maintained, archived, retrieved, or transmitted, under any records re-quirements set forth in agency regula-tions.

The notice does not constitute a determination that a hearing is justified on any objections or requests for hearing that have been filed.

All in-\\nquiries from the public about sched-uling, location, and general procedures should be addressed to the Deputy Commissioner for Policy (HF–22), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or telephone 301–443–3480. The staff of the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs will attempt to respond promptly to all inquiries from members of the public, as well as to simple requests for infor-mation from participants in hearings. (b) Hearing schedule changes. Requests \\nby hearing participants for changes in the schedule of a hearing or for filing documents, briefs, or other pleadings should be made in writing directly to the Administrative Law Judge (HF–3), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. \\n(c) Legal advice to individuals. FDA \\ndoes not have the resources to provide legal advice to members of the public concerning participation in hearings. Furthermore, to do so would com-promise the independence of the Com-missioner’s office and invite charges of improper interference in the hearing process. Accordingly, the Deputy Com-missioner for Policy (HF–22) will not answer questions about the strengths or weaknesses of a party’s position at a hearing, litigation strategy, or similar matters. \\n(d) Role of the office of the Chief Coun-\\nsel. Under no circumstances will the of-\\nfice of the Chief Counsel of FDA di-rectly provide advice about a hearing to any person who is participating or may participate in the hearing. In every hearing, certain attorneys in the office are designated to represent the center or centers whose action is the subject of the hearing. Other members of the office, including ordinarily the Chief Counsel, are designated to advise the Commissioner on a final decision in the matter.

To determine compliance with filing deadlines in a hearing, a submis-sion is considered submitted on the date it is actually received by the Divi-sion of Dockets Management. When this part allows a response to a submis-sion and prescribes a period of time for the filing of the response, an additional 3 days are allowed for the filing of the response if the submission is served by mail. \\n(b) The person making a submission \\nshall serve copies of it on the other participants. Submissions of documen-tary data and information are not re-quired to be served on each participant, but any accompanying transmittal let-ter, pleading, summary, statement of position, certification under paragraph (d) of this section, or similar document must be served on each participant. \\n(c) Service is accomplished by mail-\\ning a submission to the address shown in the notice of participation or by per-sonal delivery. \\n(d) All submissions are to be accom-\\npanied by a certificate of service, or a statement that service is not required. \\n(e) No written submission or other \\nportion of the administrative record may be held in confidence, except as provided in §12.105. \\n§ 12.82 Petition to participate in forma \\npauperis. \\n(a) A participant who believes that \\ncompliance with the filing and service requirements of this section con-stitutes an unreasonable financial bur-den may submit to the Commissioner a petition to participate in forma pauperis. \\n(b) The petition will be in the form \\nspecified in §10.30 except that the head-ing will be ‘‘Request to Participate in Forma Pauperis, Docket No. ll.’’ Fil-\\ning and service requirements for the petition are described in paragraph (c) of this section, whether or not the peti-tion is granted. The petition must dem-onstrate that either: (1) The person is indigent and a strong public interest \\njustifies participation, or (2) the per-son’s participation is in the public in-terest because it can be considered of primary benefit to the general public. \\n(c) The Commissioner may grant or \\ndeny the petition. If the petition is granted, the participant need file only one copy of each submission with the Division of Dockets Management. The Division of Dockets Management will make sufficient additional copies for the administrative record, and serve a copy on each other participant. \\n§ 12.83 Advisory opinions. \\nBefore or during a hearing, a person \\nmay, under §10.85, request the Commis-sioner for an advisory opinion on whether any regulation or order under consideration in the proceeding applies \\nto a specific situation. \\n§ 12.85 Disclosure of data and informa-\\ntion by the participants. \\n(a) Before the notice of hearing is \\npublished under §12.35, the director of the center responsible for the matters involved in the hearing shall submit the following to the Division of Dock-ets Management: \\n(1) The relevant portions of the ad-\\nministrative record of the proceeding.

If the proceeding involves particular issues, each party may determine whether, and the extent to which, each wishes to present direct testimony orally or in writing. \\n(ii) Oral cross-examination of wit-\\nnesses will be permitted if it appears that alternative means of developing the evidence are insufficient for a full and true disclosure of the facts and that the party requesting oral cross-ex-amination will be prejudiced by denial of the request or that oral cross-exam-ination is the most effective and effi-cient means to clarify the matters at issue. \\n(2) Witnesses shall give testimony \\nunder oath. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00249 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '239', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

I (4–1–22 Edition) § 14.1 \\ncommittee ( advisory committee or com-\\nmittee ) to hold a public hearing and to \\nreview and make recommendations on any matter before FDA and for inter-ested persons to present information and views at an oral public hearing be-fore the advisory committee. \\n(2) Under specific provisions in the \\nFD&C Act or other sections of this chapter, a matter is subject to a hear-ing before an advisory committee. The specific provisions are— \\n(i) Section 14.120 on review of a per-\\nformance standard for an electronic product by the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC); \\n(ii) Section 14.140 on review of the \\nsafety of color additives; \\n(iii) Section 14.160 on review of the \\nsafety and effectiveness of human pre-scription drugs; \\n(iv) Section 330.10 on review of the \\nsafety and effectiveness of over-the- counter drugs; \\n(v) [Reserved] (vi) Part 860, on classification of de-\\nvices; \\n(vii) Section 514(b)(5) of the FD&C \\nAct on establishment, amendment, or revocation of a device performance standard; \\n(viii) Section 515 of the FD&C Act on \\nreview of device premarket approval applications and product development protocols; and \\n(ix) Section 520(f) of the FD&C Act on \\nreview of device good manufacturing practice regulations. \\n(3) A person who has a right to an op-\\nportunity for a formal evidentiary pub-lic hearing under part 12 waives that opportunity and instead under §12.32 requests a hearing before an advisory committee, and the Commissioner, as a matter of discretion, accepts the re-quest. \\n(b) In determining whether a group is \\na public advisory committee as defined in \\n§10.3(a) and thus subject to this part and to the Federal advisory Committee Act, the following guidelines will be used: \\n(1) An advisory committee may be a \\nstanding advisory committee or an ad hoc advisory committee. All standing advisory committees are listed in §14.100. (2) An advisory committee may be a \\npolicy advisory committee or a tech-nical advisory committee. A policy ad-visory committee advises on broad and general matters. A technical advisory committee advises on specific tech-nical or scientific issues, which may re-late to regulatory decisions before FDA. \\n(3) An advisory committee includes \\nany of its subgroups when the subgroup is working on behalf of the committee. Section 14.40(d) describes when a sub-group will be established as an advi-sory committee separate from the par-ent committee. \\n(4) A committee composed entirely of \\nfull-time Federal Government employ-ees is not an advisory committee. \\n(5) An advisory committee ordinarily \\nhas a fixed membership, a defined pur-pose of providing advice to the agency on a particular subject, regular or peri-odic meetings, and an organizational structure, for example, a Chairperson and staff, and serves as a source of independent expertise and advice rath-er than as a representative of or advo-cate for any particular interest. The following groups are not advisory com-mittees: \\n(i) A group of persons convened on an \\nad hoc basis to discuss a matter of cur-rent interest to FDA, but which has no continuing function or organization and does not involve substantial spe-cial preparation. \\n(ii) A group of two or more FDA con-\\nsultants meeting with the agency on an ad hoc basis. \\n(iii) A group of experts who are em-\\nployed by a private company or a trade association which has been requested by FDA to provide its views on a regu-latory matter pending before FDA. \\n(iv) A consulting firm hired by FDA \\nto provide advice regarding a matter. \\n(6) An advisory committee that is \\nutilized by FDA is subject to this sub-part even though it was not established by FDA. In general, a committee is uti-\\nlized when FDA requests advice or rec-\\nommendations from the committee on a specific matter in order to obtain an independent review and consideration of the matter, and not when FDA is merely seeking the comments of all in-terested persons or of persons who have a specific interest in the matter. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00262 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '252', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='253 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 14.7 \\n(i) A committee formed by an inde-\\npendent scientific or technical organi-zation is utilized if FDA requests ad-vice of that committee rather than of the parent organization, or if the cir-cumstances show that the advice given is that of the committee and not of the parent organization. A committee formed by an independent scientific or technical organization is not utilized if FDA requests advice of the organiza-tion rather than of a committee and if the recommendations of any com-mittee formed in response to the re-quest are subject to substantial inde-pendent policy and factual review by the governing body of the parent orga-nization. \\n(ii) A committee is not utilized by \\nFDA if it provides only information, as contrasted with advice or opinions or recommendations. \\n(iii) FDA is charged with seeking out \\nthe views of all segments of the public on enforcement of the laws adminis-tered by the Commissioner. The fact that a group of individuals or a com-mittee meets regularly with FDA, for example, a monthly meeting with con-sumer representatives, does not make that group or committee an advisory committee. Thus, this subpart does not apply to routine meetings, discussions, and other dealings, including ex-changes of views, between FDA and any committee representing or advo-cating the particular interests of con-sumers, industry, professional organi-zations, or others. \\n(7) The inclusion of one or two FDA \\nconsultants who are special Govern-ment employees on an internal FDA committee does not make that com-mittee an advisory committee. \\n(8) A Public Board of Inquiry estab-\\nlished under part 13, or other similar group convened by agreement between the parties to a regulatory proceeding pending before FDA to review and pre-pare an initial decision on the issues in lieu of a formal evidentiary public hearing, is acting as an administrative law tribunal and is not an advisory committee. \\n(9) An open public conference or \\nmeeting conducted under §10.65(b) is not an advisory committee meeting. \\n(10) An FDA committee that pri-\\nmarily has operational responsibility rather than that of providing advice \\nand recommendations is not an advi-sory committee, for example, the Re-search Involving Human Subjects Com-mittee (RIHSC). \\n(c) This part applies only when a \\ncommittee convenes to conduct com-mittee business. Site visits, social gatherings, informal discussions by telephone or during meals or while \\ntraveling or at other professional func-tions, or other similar activities do not constitute a meeting. \\n(d) An advisory committee that is \\nutilized but not established by FDA is subject to this part only to the extent of such utilization, and not concerning any other activities of such committee. \\n(e) Any conference or meeting be-\\ntween an employee of FDA and a com-mittee or group which is not an advi-sory committee shall be subject to §10.65 or other provisions specifically applicable to the committee or group, for example, part 13 for a Public Board of Inquiry. \\n(f) This part applies to all FDA advi-\\nsory committees, except to the extent that specific statutes require otherwise for a particular committee, for exam-ple, TEPRSSC and advisory commit-tees established under the Medical De-vice Amendments of 1976. \\n[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 \\nFR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 78 FR 17087, Mar. 20, 2013; 81 FR 45409, July 14, 2016] \\n§ 14.5 Purpose of proceedings before \\nan advisory committee. \\n(a) An advisory committee is utilized \\nto conduct public hearings on matters of importance that come before FDA, to review the issues involved, and to provide advice and recommendations to the Commissioner. \\n(b) The Commissioner has sole discre-\\ntion concerning action to be taken and policy to be expressed on any matter considered by an advisory committee. \\n§ 14.7 Administrative remedies. \\nA person who alleges noncompliance \\nby the Commissioner or an advisory committee with any provision of this part or the Federal Advisory Com-mittee Act may pursue the following administrative remedies: \\n(a) If the person objects to any ac-\\ntion, including a failure to act, other \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00263 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '253', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

If the Commissioner deter-mines that there was noncompliance with any provision of this subpart or of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, \\nthe Commissioner will grant any ap-propriate relief and take appropriate steps to prevent its future recurrence. \\n(2) If the person objects to proposed \\nfuture action, the Commissioner will expedite the review of the petition and make a reasonable effort to render a decision before the action concerned in the petition. \\n(3) If the person objects to action \\nthat is imminent or occurring and which could not reasonably have been anticipated, e.g., the closing of a por-tion of a meeting which is made known for the first time on the day of the meeting, the matter may be handled by an oral petition in lieu of a written pe-tition. \\n(b) If the person objects to a denial of \\naccess to an advisory committee docu-ment, administrative review is in ac-cordance with the procedures estab-lished by the Department of Health and Human Services under 45 CFR 5.61—and 45 CFR 5.64. \\n[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 55 \\nFR 1404, Jan. 16, 1990; 85 FR 72906, Nov. 16, 2020] \\n§ 14.10 Applicability to Congress. \\nThis part applies to Congress, indi-\\nvidual Members of Congress, and other employees or representatives of Con-gress in the same way that they apply to any other member of the public, ex-cept that disclosure of advisory com-mittee records to Congress is governed by §20.87. \\n§ 14.15 Committees working under a \\ncontract with FDA. \\n(a) FDA may enter into contracts \\nwith independent scientific or tech-nical organizations to obtain advice and recommendations on particular matters, and these organizations may \\nin turn undertake such work through existing or new committees.

The notice may be published in the F\\nEDERAL REG-\\nISTER or disseminated by other reason-\\nable means. It is in any event to be filed with the Division of Dockets Man-agement not less than 15 days before the meeting. The time for oral presen-tations and the extent to which the committee meets in open session other than for such oral presentations is in the discretion of the committee. \\n(2) Minutes of open sessions are to be \\nmaintained, with all written submis-sions attached which were made to the committee in open session. After ap-proval, the minutes are to be forwarded to the Division of Dockets Manage-ment and placed on public display. The extent to which the committee main-tains minutes of closed sessions is in the discretion of the committee. \\n(3) In selecting the members of the \\ncommittee, the organization involved is to apply the principles relating to conflicts of interest that FDA uses in establishing a public advisory com-mittee. Those principles are set out or cross-referenced in this part and in part 19.

The Commissioner, based upon this request and with the concurrence of the Chief Counsel, will determine whether to close a portion of a meet-ing. The reasons for closing a portion of a meeting will be announced in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER notice of the meet-\\ning under §14.20 in accordance with the following rules: \\n(1) Any determination to close a por-\\ntion of a meeting restricts the closing to the shortest possible time consistent with the policy in this section. \\n(2) A portion of a meeting may be \\nclosed only if the Commissioner deter-mines that the closing is permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), and that the closing is necessary. \\n(3) Portions of meetings may ordi-\\nnarily be closed if they concern the re-view, discussion, and evaluation of drafts or regulations, guidance docu-ments or similar preexisting internal \\nagency documents, but only if their premature disclosure would signifi-cantly impede proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information; consideration of matters involving in-vestigatory files compiled for law en-forcement purposes; and review of mat-ters, the disclosure of which would con-stitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. \\n(4) Portions of meetings ordinarily \\nmay not be closed if they concern re-view, discussion, and evaluation of gen-eral preclinical and clinical test proto-cols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices; consideration of labeling re-quirements for a class of marketed drugs and devices; review of informa-tion on specific investigational or mar-keted drugs and devices that have pre-viously been made public; presentation of any other information not exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c); the formulation of advice and recommendations to FDA on matters that do not independently justify clos-ing. \\n(5) No portion of a meeting devoted \\nto matters other than those designated in paragraph (b) (1) through (3) of this section may be closed. \\n(6) A matter which is properly con-\\nsidered in an open portion of a meeting may instead be considered in a closed portion only if it is so inextricably intertwined with matters to be dis-cussed in a closed portion that it is not feasible to separate them or discussion of the matter in an open portion would compromise the matters to be dis-cussed in the closed portion. \\n(c) Attendance at a closed portion of \\na meeting is governed by the following rules: \\n(1) A portion of a meeting closed for \\nthe presentation or discussion of infor-mation that constitutes a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in §20.61 may be attended only by voting advisory com-mittee members, nonvoting members representing consumer interests who are also special government employees as provided in §14.80(b), the Designated Federal Officer of the advisory com-mittee, a transcriber, consultants, and such other regular employees of FDA \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00267 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '257', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Interested persons may nominate one or more qualified persons to represent \\nconsumer interests. Although nomina-tions from individuals will be accepted, individuals are encouraged to submit their nominations through consumer organizations as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Nominations of qualified persons for general consider-ation as nonvoting members of unspec-ified advisory committees or sub-committees may be made at any time.

After the time for return of the ballots has expired, the ballots will be counted and the nominee who has received the highest number of votes will be selected as the nonvoting member representing con-sumer interests for that particular ad-visory committee or subcommittee. In the event of a tie, the Commissioner \\nwill select the winner by lot from among those tied for the highest num-ber of votes \\n(5) If a member representing con-\\nsumer interests resigns or is removed before termination of the committee on which the member is serving, the following procedures will be used to ap-point a replacement to serve out the term of the former member: \\n(i) The Commissioner will appoint \\nthe runner-up, in order of number of ballots received, on the original ballot submitted under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to fill the vacancy. If the runner-up is no longer willing to serve as a member, then the next runner-up will be appointed. \\n(ii) If none of the nominees on the \\noriginal ballot is willing to serve, or if there was only one nominee on the original ballot, the Advisory Com-mittee Oversight and Management Staff will contact by telephone eligible individuals whose names have been submitted in the past as candidates for membership as representatives of con-sumer interests. A list of persons who are interested in serving on an advi-sory committee will then be prepared. The curricula vitae of these persons, together with a ballot, will be sent to a representative number of consumer organizations that have been deter-mined to be eligible to vote for con-sumer representatives in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. After 4 days have elapsed, the Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff will contact the consumer organi-zations by telephone and elicit their votes. The candidate who has received the highest number of votes will be se-lected. In the event of a tie, the Com-missioner will select the winner by lot from among those tied for the highest \\nnumber of votes. \\n(d) To select a nonvoting member to \\nrepresent industry interests, the Com-missioner will publish, for each com-mittee for which the Commissioner has determined to appoint a nonvoting member, a notice requesting that, within 30 days, any industry organiza-tion interested in participating in the selection of an appropriate nonvoting member to represent industry interests send a letter stating that interest to the FDA employee designated in the notice. After 30 days, a letter will be sent to each organization that has ex-pressed an interest, attaching a com-plete list of all such organizations, and stating that it is their responsibility to consult with each other in selecting, within 60 days after receipt of the let-ter, a single nonvoting member to rep-resent industry interests for that com-mittee. If no individual is selected within 60 days, the Commissioner will select the nonvoting member rep-\\nresenting industry interests. \\n(e) The Commissioner has determined \\nthat, because nonvoting members rep-resenting consumer and industry inter-ests are included on advisory commit-tees specifically for the purpose of rep-resenting such interests and have no vote, any financial interest covered by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) in the class which the member represents is irrelevant to the services the Government expects from them and thus is hereby exempted under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) as too remote and inconsequential to affect the integ-rity of their services. \\n[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 \\nFR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 75 FR 15342, Mar. 29, 2010] \\n§ 14.86 Rights and responsibilities of \\nnonvoting members of advisory committees. \\n(a) A nonvoting member of an advi-\\nsory committee selected to represent and serve as a liaison with interested individuals, associations, and organiza-tions has the same rights as any other committee member except that— \\n(1) A nonvoting member may vote \\nonly on procedural matters such as ad-ditional rules adopted under §14.39(a), \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00277 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '267', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Accordingly, an interested person with-in the class represented by that non-voting member may, upon request, have access to all written statements or oral briefings concerning the com-mittee prepared by the nonvoting member for distribution to any person outside the committee.

A committee member will not be paid for time spent on normal prepara-tion for a committee meeting. \\n(1) An agency-directed assignment is \\nan assignment that meets the fol-lowing criteria: \\n(i) An activity that requires under-\\ntaking a definitive study. The activity must produce a tangible end product, usually a written report. Examples are: \\n(a) An analysis of the risks and bene-\\nfits of the use of a class of drugs or a report on a specific problem generated by an IND or NDA; \\n(b) The performance of similar inves-\\ntigations or analysis of complex indus-try submissions to support advisory committee deliberations other than normal meeting preparation; \\n(c) The preparation of a statistical \\nanalysis leading to an estimate of toxicologically safe dose levels; and \\n(d) The design or analysis of animal \\nstudies of toxicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. \\n(ii) The performance of an IND or \\nNDA review or similar review. (2) A committee member who under-\\ntakes a special assignment, the end product of which does not represent the end product of the advisory committee, but rather of the committee member’s own assignment, can be compensated. Should this preparatory work by mem-bers collectively result in an end prod-uct of the committee, this is to be con-sidered normal meeting preparation and committee members are not to be compensated for this work. \\n(d) Salary while in travel status is \\nauthorized when a committee mem-ber’s ordinary pursuits are interrupted for the substantial portion of an addi-tional day beyond the day or days spent in performing those services, and as a consequence the committee mem-ber loses some regular compensation. This applies on weekends and holidays if the special Government employee loses income that would otherwise be earned on that day. For travel pur-poses, a substantial portion of a day is defined as 50 percent of the working day, and the traveler will be paid at a daily rate. \\n[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 53 \\nFR 50949, Dec. 19, 1988] \\nSubpart F—Standing Advisory \\nCommittees \\n§ 14.100 List of standing advisory com-\\nmittees. \\nStanding advisory committees and \\nthe dates of their establishment are as follows: \\n(a) Office of the Commissioner — \\n(1) Board of Tea Experts. \\n(i) Date established: March 2, 1897.

The Com-missioner’s determinations on the agenda of the committee are based upon the priorities of the various mat-ters pending before the agency which fall within the pharmacologic class covered by that committee. (b) High priority for such hearing and \\nreview by the appropriate standing technical advisory committee for human prescription drugs are given to the following types of human prescrip-tion drugs: \\n(1) Investigational drugs which are \\npotential therapeutic advances over currently marketed products from the standpoint of safety or effectiveness, or which pose significant safety hazards, or which present narrow benefit-risk considerations requiring a close judgmental decision on approval for marketing, or which have a novel de-livery system or formulation, or which are the subject of major scientific or public controversy, or which may be subject to special regulatory require-ments such as a limitation on clinical trials, a patient followup requirement, postmarketing Phase IV studies, dis-tributional controls, or boxed warn-ings. \\n(2) Marketed drugs for which an im-\\nportant new use has been discovered or which pose newly discovered safety hazards, or which are the subject of major scientific or public controversy, or which may be subject to important regulatory actions such as withdrawal of approval for marketing, boxed warn-ings, distributional controls, or newly required scientific studies. \\n(c) The committee may request the \\nCommissioner for an opportunity to hold a public hearing and to review any matter involving a human prescription drug which falls within the pharmaco-logic class covered by the committee. The Commissioner may, after con-sulting with the committee on such re-quest, grant or deny the request in light of the priorities of the other mat-ters pending before the committee. Whenever feasible, consistent with the other work of the committee, the re-quest will be granted. \\n(d) For a drug that meets any of the \\ncriteria established in paragraph (b) of this section, one or more members of or consultants to the appropriate advi-sory committee may be selected for more detailed monitoring of the mat-ter and consultation with FDA on be-half of the committee.

If there has been prior participation, the Commis-sioner or the delegate should, if fea-sible, designate a presiding officer for the hearing who is not a subordinate. Thus, if the Commissioner’s authority \\nto make a final decision has been dele-gated to a center director, the pre-siding officer may be an official in an-other center or the office of the Com-missioner. The exercise of general su-pervisory responsibility, or the des-ignation of the presiding officer, does not constitute prior participation in the investigation or action that is the subject of the hearing so as to preclude the Commissioner or delegate from designating a subordinate as the pre-siding officer. (2) The party requesting a hearing \\nmay make a written request to have the Commissioner or the delegate under §16.40 be the presiding officer, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

This rule does not authorize exclusion of: \\n(1) A party who is an individual; (2) In the case of a party that is not \\nan individual, an officer or employee of the party designated to be the party’s sole representative for purposes of the hearing; or \\n(3) An individual whose presence is \\nshown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by a party en-gaged in assisting counsel for the party. \\n(g) If a witness’ testimony is sub-\\nmitted in writing prior to cross-exam-ination, the cross-examining party need not subpoena the witness or pay for his or her travel to the hearing.

Evidence of conduct or state-ments made in settlement negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of settlement negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness or opposing a contention of undue delay. \\n(g) The presiding officer may in his \\nor her discretion permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evi-dence. \\n(h) All documents and other evidence \\noffered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by all parties, un-less otherwise ordered by the presiding \\nofficer pursuant to §17.28. \\n§ 17.41 The administrative record. \\n(a) The hearing will be recorded and \\ntranscribed.

Such briefs may be accom-panied by proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The presiding offi-cer may permit the parties to file re-sponsive briefs. No brief may exceed 30 pages (exclusive of proposed findings and conclusions) unless the presiding officer has previously found that the issues in the proceeding are so com-plex, or the administrative record is so voluminous, as to justify longer briefs, in which case the presiding officer may set a longer page limit. Proposed find-ings of fact and conclusions of law shall not exceed 30 pages unless the presiding officer has previously found that the issues in the proceeding are so complex, or the administrative record is so voluminous, as to justify longer proposed findings and conclusions, in which case the presiding officer may set a longer page limit. \\n§ 17.45 Initial decision. \\n(a) The presiding officer shall issue \\nan initial decision based only on the administrative record. The decision shall contain findings of fact, conclu-sions of law, and the amount of any penalties and assessments imposed. \\n(b) The findings of fact shall include \\na finding on each of the following issues: \\n(1) Whether the allegations in the \\ncomplaint are true, and, if so, whether respondent’s actions identified in the complaint violated the law; \\n(2) Whether any affirmative defenses \\nare meritorious; and \\n(3) If the respondent is liable for pen-\\nalties or assessments, the appropriate amount of any such penalties or assess-\\nments, considering any mitigating or aggravating factors that he or she finds in the case. \\n(c) The presiding officer shall serve \\nthe initial decision or the decision granting summary decision on all par-ties within 90 days after the time for submission of posthearing briefs and responsive briefs (if permitted) has ex-pired.

How-ever, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in §20.46 or for other reasons. \\n(1) Commercial use request. If the re-\\nquest is for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search, review, and du-plication. (2) Educational and scientific institu-\\ntions and news media. If the request is \\nfrom an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated primarily for scholarly or sci-entific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication. \\n(3) Other requests. If the request is not \\nthe kind described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the search and the duplication. Also, the Food and Drug Administra-tion will not charge for the first 2 hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplica-tion. \\n(b) General provisions. (1) The Food \\nand Drug Administration may charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure or if no records are found. \\n(2) If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this \\nsection, there is no charge for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours are spent on a computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the operator’s own operation. If the operator spends less than 2 hours on the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly rate for the operator’s time, multiplied by 2. \\n(3) If, under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) \\nof this section, there is no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication, then those 100 pages are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages of computer print-out. If this method to calculate the fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be reduced by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100. \\n(4) No charge will be made if the \\ncosts of routine collection and proc-essing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee. \\n(5) If it is determined that a re-\\nquester (acting either alone or together with others) is breaking down a single request into a series of requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00320 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '310', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Provi-sions in 45 CFR part 30, the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims collec-tion, will be used in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment. \\n(c) Fee schedule. The Food and Drug \\nAdministration charges the following fees in accordance with the regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services at 45 CFR part 5. \\n(1) Manual searching for or reviewing \\nof records. When the search or review is \\nperformed by employees at grade GS–1 through GS–8, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS–5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS–9 through GS–14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS–12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS–15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS–15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade and step, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. When a search in-volves employees at more than one of these levels, the Food and Drug Admin-istration will charge the rate appro-priate for each. \\n(2) Computer searching and printing. \\nThe actual cost of operating the com-puter plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. \\n(3) Photocopying standard size pages. \\n$0.10 per page. Freedom of Information Officers may charge lower fees for par-ticular documents where: \\n(i) The document has already been \\nprinted in large numbers; \\n(ii) The program office determines \\nthat using existing stock to answer this request, and any other anticipated Freedom of Information requests, will not interfere with program require-ments; and \\n(iii) The Freedom of Information Of-\\nficer determines that the lower fee is adequate to recover the prorated share of the original printing costs. (4) Photocopying odd-size documents \\n(such as punchcards or blueprints), or re-producing other records (such as tapes). The actual costs of operating the ma-chine, plus the actual cost of the mate-rials used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this sec-tion. \\n(5) Certifying that records are true cop-\\nies. This service is not required by the \\nFreedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug Administration agrees to provide certification, there is a $10 charge per certification. \\n(6) Sending records by express mail or \\nother special methods. This service is not \\nrequired by the Freedom of Informa-tion Act. If the Food and Drug Admin-istration agrees to provide this service, the requester will be required to di-rectly pay, or be directly charged by, the courier. The agency will not agree to any special delivery method that does not permit the requester to di-rectly pay or be directly charged for the service. \\n(7) Performing any other special service \\nin connection with a request to which the Food and Drug Administration has agreed. Actual costs of operating any \\nmachinery, plus actual cost of any ma-terials used, plus charges for the time of the Food and Drug Administration’s employees, at the rates given in para-graph (c)(1) of this section. \\n(d) Procedures for assessing and col-\\nlecting fees —(1) Agreement to pay. The \\nFood and Drug Administration gen-erally assumes that a requester is will-ing to pay the fees charged for services associated with the request. The re-quester may specify a limit on the \\namount to be spent. If it appears that the fees will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to proceed with the search. \\n(2) Advance payment. If a requester \\nhas failed to pay previous bills in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration’s initial review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the requester will be re-quired to pay past due fees and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00321 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '311', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Ordinarily, \\nthe requester will be required to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Ad-ministration will furnish the records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send the requester a bill along with or following the records. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a history of prompt pay-ment. The Food and Drug Administra-tion may also, at its discretion, aggre-gate the charges for certain time peri-ods in order to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to businesses or agents representing re-questers. For example, the Food and Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month. Fees should be paid in accordance with the instructions furnished by the person who responds to the request. \\n[59 FR 533, Jan. 5, 1994. Redesignated and \\namended at 68 FR 25286, May 12, 2003] \\n§ 20.46 Waiver or reduction of fees. \\n(a) Standard. The Assistant Commis-\\nsioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee) will waive or reduce the fees that would otherwise be charged if disclo-sure of the information meets both of the following tests: \\n(1) Is in the public interest because it \\nis likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and \\n(2) It is not primarily in the commer-\\ncial interest of the requester. These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. \\n(b) Public interest. Disclosure of infor-\\nmation satisfies the first test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may fur-ther. In analyzing this question, the Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors: (1) Whether the records to be dis-\\nclosed pertain to the operations or ac-tivities of the Federal Government; \\n(2) Whether disclosure of the records \\nwould reveal any meaningful informa-tion about Government operations or activities that is not already public knowledge; \\n(3) Whether disclosure will advance \\nthe understanding of the general public as distinguished from a narrow seg-ment of interested persons. Under this factor, the Food and Drug Administra-tion may consider whether the re-quester is in a position to contribute to public understanding. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the informa-tion, and whether the requester’s in-tended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information to the public. An unsupported claim to be doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a representative of the news media is better evidence; and \\n(4) Whether the contribution to pub-\\nlic understanding will be a significant one, i.e., will the public’s under-standing of the Government’s oper-ations be substantially greater as a re-sult of the disclosure. \\n(c) Not primarily in the requester’s com-\\nmercial interest. If disclosure passes the \\ntest of furthering the specific public in-terest described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Food and Drug Adminis-tration will determine whether disclo-sure also furthers the requester’s com-mercial interest and, if so, whether this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test, the Food and Drug Admin-istration will consider the following factors: \\n(1) Whether disclosure would further \\na commercial interest of the requester, or of someone on whose behalf the re-quester is acting. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Both profit and non-profit-making corporations have com-mercial interests, as well as individ-uals, unions, and other associations.

If the disclosure of the informa-\\ntion requested passes both tests de-scribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Food and Drug Adminis-tration will normally waive fees. How-ever, in some cases the Food and Drug Administration may decide only to re-\\nduce the fees. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this when disclosure of some but not all of the requested records passes the tests. \\n(e) Procedure for requesting a waiver or \\nreduction. A requester must request a \\nwaiver or reduction of fees at the same time as the request for records. The re-quester should explain why a waiver or reduction is proper under the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Only the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If the Food and Drug Administration does not completely grant the request for a waiver or reduc-tion, the denial letter will designate a review official. The requester may ap-peal the denial to that official. The ap-peal letter should address reasons for the Associate Commissioner’s decision that are set forth in the denial letter. \\n[59 FR 534, Jan. 5, 1994.

The person affected will be per-mitted 5 days after receipt of notifica-tion of such decision within which to institute suit in a United States Dis-trict Court to enjoin release of the records involved.

For example, correspondence that is ordinarily disclosable under §20.103 is not disclosable to the extent that it contains trade secrets exempt from dis-closure under §20.61 and is not subject to discretionary release under §20.82. \\n(b) Where application of one or more \\nexemptions results in a record being disclosable in part and nondisclosable in part, the rule established in §20.22 shall apply. \\n§ 20.61 Trade secrets and commercial \\nor financial information which is privileged or confidential. \\n(a) A trade secret may consist of any \\ncommercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial ef-fort. There must be a direct relation-ship between the trade secret and the productive process. \\n(b) Commercial or financial informa-\\ntion that is privileged or confidential means valuable data or information which is used in one’s business and is of a type customarily held in strict con-fidence or regarded as privileged and not disclosed to any member of the public by the person to whom it be-longs. \\n(c) Data and information submitted \\nor divulged to the Food and Drug Ad-ministration which fall within the defi-nitions of a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information are not available for public disclosure. \\n(d) A person who submits records to \\nthe Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt from disclosure under ex-emption 4 of the Freedom of Informa-tion Act. The person may make this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the Govern-ment or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must be in writing.

These procedures also apply to records that were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration when the agency has substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered exempt under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. Certain exceptions to these procedures are set forth in para-graph (f) of this section. \\n(1) When the Food and Drug Adminis-\\ntration receives a request for such records and determines that disclosure may be required, the Food and Drug Administration will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts. The notice will include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits for submission and consid-eration of objections to disclosure. If the Food and Drug Administration must notify a large number of submit-ters, notification may be done by post-ing or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of it. \\n(2) The submitter has 5 working days \\nfrom receipt of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases for its objections. \\n(3) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion will give consideration to all bases that have been stated in a timely man-ner by the submitter. If the Food and Drug Administration decides to dis-close the records, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the sub-mitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why the agency did not sustain the submitter’s objections. The Food and Drug Administration will in-clude with the notice a copy of the records about which the submitter ob-jected, as the agency proposes to dis-close them. The notice will state that the Food and Drug Administration in-tends to disclose the records 5 working days after the submitter receives the notice unless a U.S. District Court or-ders the agency not to release them. (4) If a requester files suit under the \\nFreedom of Information Act to obtain records covered by this paragraph, the Food and Drug Administration will promptly notify the submitter. \\n(5) Whenever the Food and Drug Ad-\\nministration sends a notice to a sub-mitter under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Food and Drug Adminis-tration will notify the requester that the Food and Drug Administration is giving the submitter a notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the re-quester of this fact. \\n(f) The notice requirements in para-\\ngraph (e) of this section do not apply in the following situations: \\n(1) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion decided not to disclose the records; \\n(2) The information has previously \\nbeen published or made generally available; \\n(3) Disclosure is required by a regula-\\ntion issued after notice and oppor-tunity for public comment, that speci-fies narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the Freedom \\nof Information Act, but in this case a submitter may still designate records as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and in exceptional cases, the Food and Drug Administration may, at its discretion, follow the notice proce-dures in paragraph (e) of this section; \\n(4) The information requested has not \\nbeen designated by the submitter as ex-empt from disclosure when the sub-mitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the informa-tion or within a reasonable time there-after, unless the Food and Drug Admin-istration has substantial reason to be-lieve that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or \\n(5) The designation appears to be ob-\\nviously frivolous, but in this case the Food and Drug Administration will still give the submitter the written no-tice required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section (although this notice need not explain our decision or include a copy of the records), and the Food and Drug \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00326 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '316', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Any such business enterprise that is identified by the name of one or more individuals is not \\nan individual within the meaning of this part. Employees of regulated busi-ness enterprises are considered individ-uals. Accordingly, physicians and other health professionals who are engaged in business as proprietors of establish-ments regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are not considered in-dividuals; however, physicians and other health professionals who are en-gaged in clinical investigations, em-ployed by regulated enterprises, or the subjects of records concerning their own health, e.g., exposure to excessive radiation, are considered individuals.

The term in-cludes such a system of records wheth-\\ner subject to a notice published by the Food and Drug Administration, the De-partment, or another agency. Where records are retrieved only by personal identifiers other than individual names, a system of records is not a Pri-vacy Act Record System if the Food and Drug Administration cannot, by reference to information under its con-trol, or by reference to records of con-tractors that are subject to this part under §21.30, ascertain the identity of individuals who are the subjects of the records. \\n(d) Personal identifiers includes indi-\\nvidual names, identifying numbers, symbols, or other identifying designa-tions assigned to individuals.

If it is deter-mined that disclosure is not likely to have an adverse effect on the indi-vidual, the record shall be disclosed to him. If it is determined that disclosure is very likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, he may be requested to designate, in writing, a representa-tive to whom the record shall be dis-closed.

To help assure a prompt response, an indi-vidual should indicate that he is mak-ing a ‘‘Privacy Act Request’’ on the en-velope and in a prominent manner in the letter. \\n(d) An individual who merely wishes \\nto be notified whether a Privacy Act Record System contains a record about him ordinarily need not provide any verification of his identity other than his name. The mere fact that the Food and Drug Administration has a record about an individual in any of its Pri-vacy Act Records Systems would not be likely to constitute a clearly unwar-ranted invasion of personal privacy.

      "page_content='352 21 CFR Ch. I (4–1–22 Edition) § 25.10 \\n§ 25.10 Policies and NEPA planning. \\n(a) All FDA’s policies and programs \\nwill be planned, developed, and imple-mented to achieve the policies declared by NEPA and required by CEQ’s regula-tions to ensure responsible stewardship of the environment for present and fu-ture generations. \\n(b) Assessment of environmental fac-\\ntors continues throughout planning and is integrated with other program planning at the earliest possible time to ensure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to avoid potential conflicts. \\n(c) For actions initiated by the agen-\\ncy, the NEPA process will begin when the agency action under consideration is first identified. For actions initiated by applicants or petitioners, NEPA planning begins when FDA receives from an applicant or petitioner an EA or a claim that a categorical exclusion applies, or when FDA personnel consult with applicants or petitioners on the NEPA-related aspects of their re-quested actions. FDA may issue a pub-lic call for environmental data or oth-erwise consult with affected individ-uals or groups when a contemplated ac-tion in which it is or may be involved poses potential significant environ-mental effects. \\n(d) Environmental documents shall \\nconcentrate on timely and significant issues, not amass needless detail. \\n(e) If a proposed action for which an \\nEIS will be prepared involves possible environmental effects that are required to be considered under statutes or Ex-ecutive Orders other than those re-ferred to under ‘‘Authority’’ in this part, these effects shall be considered in the NEPA review, consistent with 40 CFR 1502.25 and the HHS General Ad-ministration Manual, part 30: Environ-mental Protection. \\nSubpart B—Agency Actions Re-\\nquiring Environmental Consid-eration \\n§ 25.15 General procedures. \\n(a) All applications or petitions re-\\nquesting agency action require the sub-mission of an EA or a claim of categor-ical exclusion. A claim of categorical exclusion shall include a statement of \\ncompliance with the categorical exclu-sion criteria and shall state that to the applicant’s knowledge, no extraor-dinary circumstances exist. Failure to submit an adequate EA for an applica-tion or petition requesting action by the agency of a type specified in §25.20, unless the agency can determine that the action qualifies for exclusion under §§25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35 is sufficient grounds for FDA to refuse to file or approve the application or pe-tition. An EA adequate for filing is one that addresses the relevant environ-mental issues. An EA adequate for ap-proval is one that contains sufficient information to enable the agency to de-termine whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. \\n(b) The responsible agency officials \\nwill evaluate the information con-tained in the EA to determine whether it is accurate and objective, whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human envi-ronment, and whether an EIS will be prepared. If significant effects requir-ing the preparation of an EIS are iden-tified, FDA will prepare an EIS for the action in accordance with the proce-dures in subparts D and E of this part. If significant effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are not identi-fied, resulting in a decision not to pre-pare an EIS, the responsible agency of-ficial will prepare a FONSI in accord-ance with §25.41. \\n(c) Classes of actions that individ-\\nually or cumulatively do not signifi-cantly affect the quality of the human environment ordinarily are excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or an EIS. The classes of actions that qualify as categorical exclusions are set forth in §§25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35. \\n(d) A person submitting an applica-\\ntion or petition of a type subject to categorical exclusion under §§25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35, or pro-posing to dispose of an article as pro-vided in §25.30(d) or 25.32(h), is not re-quired to submit an EA if the person states that the action requested quali-fies for a categorical exclusion, citing the particular categorical exclusion that is claimed, and states that to the \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00362 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '352', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Applicants and petitioners are en-couraged to submit proposed protocols for environmental studies for technical review by agency staff.

The responsible agen-cy official examines the environmental risks of the proposed action and the al-ternative courses of action, selects a course of action, and ensures that any necessary mitigating measures are im-plemented as a condition for approving the selected course of action. \\n[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 69 \\nFR 17291, Apr. 2, 2004; 80 FR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015] \\n§ 25.41 Findings of no significant im-\\npact. \\n(a) As defined by the CEQ regulations \\n(40 CFR 1508.13), a FONSI is a document prepared by a Federal agency stating briefly why an action, not otherwise excluded, will not significantly affect the human environment and for which, therefore, an EIS will not be prepared. A FONSI includes the EA or a sum-mary of it and a reference to any other related environmental documents.

If an action affects more than one center within FDA, the Commis-sioner of Food and Drugs will designate one of these units to be responsible for coordinating the preparation of any re-quired environmental documentation. \\n§ 25.45 Responsible agency official. \\n(a) The responsible agency official \\nprepares the environmental documents or ensures that they are prepared. \\n(b) The responsible agency official \\nwill weigh any environmental impacts of each alternative course of action, in-cluding possible mitigation measures, and will balance environmental im-pacts with the agency’s objectives in choosing an appropriate course of ac-tion. The weighing of any environ-\\nmental impacts of alternatives in se-lecting a final course of action will be reflected in the agency’s record of for-mal decisionmaking as required by 40 CFR 1505.2. \\n[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 69 \\nFR 17291, Apr. 2, 2004] \\nSubpart E—Public Participation \\nand Notification of Environ-mental Documents \\n§ 25.50 General information. \\n(a) To the extent actions are not pro-\\ntected from disclosure by existing law applicable to the agency’s operation, FDA will involve the public in pre-paring and implementing its NEPA procedures and will provide public no-tice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, and the availability of envi-ronmental documents. \\n(b) Many FDA actions involving in-\\nvestigations, review, and approval or market authorization of applications, and premarket notifications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, and tobacco products are pro-tected from disclosure under the Trade Secret Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, and section 301(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and \\nCosmetic Act. These actions are also protected from disclosure under FDA’s regulations including part 20, §§312.130(a), 314.430(b), 514.11(b), 514.12(a), 601.50(a), 601.51(a), 807.95(b), 812.38(a), and 814.9(b) of this chapter. Even the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, and tobacco products is protected from disclosure under \\nthese regulations. Therefore, unless the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, tobacco products, or premarket notifi-cation for devices has been made pub-licly available, the release of the envi-ronmental document before approval or authorization of human drugs, ani-mal drugs, biologic products, devices and tobacco products is inconsistent with statutory requirements imposed on FDA. Appropriate environmental documents, comments, and responses will be included in the administrative record to the extent allowed by appli-cable laws. \\n[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 80 \\nFR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015] \\n§ 25.51 Environmental assessments \\nand findings of no significant im-pact. \\n(a) Data and information that are \\nprotected from disclosure by 18 U.S.C. 1905 or 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 360j(c) shall not be included in the portion of envi-ronmental documents that is made public.

For codification purposes, certain provisions of the MRA have been modified for use in this part. This modification is done for purposes of clarity only and shall not affect the text of the MRA concluded between the United States and the European Com-munity (EC), or the rights and obliga-tions of the United States or the EC under that agreement. Whereas the \\nparties to the MRA are the United States and EC, this part is relevant only to the Food and Drug Administra-tion’s (FDA’s) implementation of the MRA, including the sectoral annexes reflected in subparts A and B of this part. This part does not govern imple-mentation of the MRA by the EC, which will implement the MRA in ac-cordance with its internal procedures, nor does this part address implementa-tion of the MRA by other concerned U.S. Federal agencies. For purposes of this part, the terms ‘‘party’’ or ‘‘par-ties,’’ where relevant to FDA’s imple-mentation of the MRA, should be con-sidered as referring to FDA only. If the parties to the MRA subsequently amend or terminate the MRA, FDA will modify this part accordingly, using appropriate administrative pro-cedures. \\nSubpart A—Specific Sector Provi-\\nsions for Pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Prac-tices \\n§ 26.1 Definitions. \\n(a) Enforcement means action taken \\nby an authority to protect the public from products of suspect quality, safe-ty, and effectiveness or to assure that products are manufactured in compli-ance with appropriate laws, regula-tions, standards, and commitments made as part of the approval to market a product. \\n(b) Equivalence of the regulatory sys-\\ntems means that the systems are suffi-ciently comparable to assure that the process of inspection and the ensuing inspection reports will provide ade-quate information to determine wheth-er respective statutory and regulatory requirements of the authorities have been fulfilled. Equivalence does not re-quire that the respective regulatory systems have identical procedures. \\n(c) Good Manufacturing Practices \\n(GMP’s).

For the purpose of this subpart, GMP’s include, therefore, the system whereby the manufacturer receives the specifica-tions of the product and/or process from the marketing authorization/ product authorization or license holder or applicant and ensures the product is made in compliance with its specifica-tions (qualified person certification in the EC). \\n(d) Inspection means an onsite evalua-\\ntion of a manufacturing facility to de-termine whether such manufacturing facility is operating in compliance with GMP’s and/or commitments made as part of the approval to market a product. \\n(e) Inspection report means the writ-\\nten observations and GMP’s compli-ance assessment completed by an au-thority listed in appendix B of this sub-part. \\n(f) Regulatory system means the body \\nof legal requirements for GMP’s, in-\\nspections, and enforcements that en-sure public health protection and legal authority to assure adherence to these requirements. \\n[63 FR 60141, Nov. 6, 1998; 64 FR 16348, Apr. 5, \\n1999] \\n§ 26.2 Purpose. \\nThe provisions of this subpart govern \\nthe exchange between the parties and normal endorsement by the receiving regulatory authority of official good manufacturing practices (GMP’s) in-spection reports after a transitional pe-riod aimed at determination of the equivalence of the regulatory systems of the parties, which is the cornerstone of this subpart. § 26.3 Scope. \\n(a) The provisions of this subpart \\nshall apply to pharmaceutical inspec-tions carried out in the United States and Member States of the European Community (EC) before products are marketed (hereafter referred to as ‘‘preapproval inspections’’) as well as during their marketing (hereafter re-ferred to as ‘‘postapproval inspec-tions’’). \\n(b) Appendix A of this subpart names \\nthe laws, regulations, and administra-tive provisions governing these inspec-tions and the good manufacturing prac-tices (GMP’s) requirements. \\n(c) Appendix B of this subpart lists \\nthe authorities participating in activi-ties under this subpart. \\n(d) Sections 26.65, 26.66, 26.67, 26.68, \\n26.69, and 26.70 of subpart C of this part do not apply to this subpart. \\n§ 26.4 Product coverage. \\n(a) The provisions of this subpart will \\napply to medicinal products for human or animal use, intermediates and start-ing materials (as referred to in the Eu-ropean Community (EC)) and to drugs for human or animal use, biological products for human use, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (as referred to in the United States), only to the extent they are regulated by the au-thorities of both parties as listed in ap-pendix B of this subpart. \\n(b) Human blood, human plasma, \\nhuman tissues and organs, and veteri-nary immunologicals (under 9 CFR 101.2, ‘‘veterinary immunologicals’’ are referred to as ‘‘veterinary biologicals’’) are excluded from the scope of this sub-part. Human plasma derivatives (such as immunoglobulins and albumin), in-vestigational medicinal products/new drugs, human radiopharmaceuticals, and medicinal gases are also excluded during the transition phase; their situ-ation will be reconsidered at the end of the transition period.

Based on the determination of equivalence in light of the experience gained, these inspec-tion reports will normally be endorsed by the authority of the importing party, except under specific and delin-eated circumstances. Examples of such circumstances include indications of material inconsistencies or inadequa-cies in an inspection report, quality de-fects identified in the postmarket sur-veillance or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product quality or consumer safety. In such cases, the authority of the importing party may request clarification from the authority of the exporting party which may lead to a request for rein-spection. The authorities will endeavor to respond to requests for clarification in a timely manner. \\n(b) Where divergence is not clarified \\nin this process, an authority of the im-porting country may carry out an in-\\nspection of the production facility. \\n§ 26.13 Transmission of postapproval \\ninspection reports. \\nPostapproval good manufacturing \\npractice (GMP) inspection reports con-cerning products covered by this sub-part will be transmitted to the author-ity of the importing country within 60- calendar days of the request. Should a new inspection be needed, the inspec-tion report will be transmitted within 90-calendar days of the request. \\n§ 26.14 Transmission of preapproval \\ninspection reports. \\n(a) A preliminary notification that \\nan inspection may have to take place will be made as soon as possible. \\n(b) Within 15-calendar days, the rel-\\nevant authority will acknowledge re-ceipt of the request and confirm its ability to carry out the inspection. In the European Community (EC), re-quests will be sent directly to the rel-evant authority, with a copy to the Eu-ropean Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA). If the au-thority receiving the request cannot carry out the inspection as requested, the requesting authority shall have the right to conduct the inspection. \\n(c) Reports of preapproval inspec-\\ntions will be sent within 45-calendar days of the request that transmitted the appropriate information and de-tailed the precise issues to be addressed during the inspection. A shorter time may be necessary in exceptional cases and these will be described in the re-quest. \\n§ 26.15 Monitoring continued equiva-\\nlence. \\nMonitoring activities for the purpose \\nof maintaining equivalence shall in-clude review of the exchange of inspec-tion reports and their quality and timeliness; performance of a limited number of joint inspections; and the conduct of common training sessions. \\n§ 26.16 Suspension. \\n(a) Each party has the right to con-\\ntest the equivalence of a regulatory au-thority.

The parties will review this subpart periodically, in order to assess progress and identify potential en-hancements to this subpart as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Community (EC) policies evolve over time. \\n§ 26.32 Scope. \\n(a) The provisions of this subpart \\nshall apply to the exchange and, where appropriate, endorsement of the fol-lowing types of reports from con-formity assessment bodies (CAB’s) as-sessed to be equivalent: \\n(1) Under the U.S. system, surveil-\\nlance/postmarket and initial/ preapproval inspection reports; \\n(2) Under the U.S. system, premarket \\n(510(k)) product evaluation reports; \\n(3) Under the European Community \\n(EC) system, quality system evaluation reports; and \\n(4) Under the EC system, EC type ex-\\namination and verification reports. \\n(b) Appendix A of this subpart names \\nthe legislation, regulations, and re-lated procedures under which: \\n(1) Products are regulated as medical \\ndevices by each party; \\n(2) CAB’s are designated and con-\\nfirmed; and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00380 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '370', 'website_url': '/'}\n",
      "page_content='371 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 26.37 \\n(3) These reports are prepared. \\n(c) For purposes of this subpart, \\nequivalence means that: CAB’s in the EC are capable of conducting product and quality systems evaluations against U.S. regulatory requirements in a manner equivalent to those con-ducted by FDA; and CAB’s in the United States are capable of con-ducting product and quality systems evaluations against EC regulatory re-quirements in a manner equivalent to those conducted by EC CAB’s. \\n§ 26.33 Product coverage. \\n(a) There are three components to \\nthis subpart each covering a discrete range of products: \\n(1) Quality System Evaluations. U.S.- \\ntype surveillance/postmarket and ini-tial/preapproval inspection reports and European Community (EC)-type qual-ity system evaluation reports will be exchanged with regard to all products regulated under both U.S. and EC law as medical devices. \\n(2) Product Evaluation. U.S.-type pre-\\nmarket (510(k)) product evaluation re-ports and EC-type-testing reports will be exchanged only with regard to those products classified under the U.S. sys-tem as Class I/Class II-Tier 2 medical devices which are listed in appendix B of this subpart. \\n(3) Postmarket Vigilance Reports. \\nPostmarket vigilance reports will be exchanged with regard to all products regulated under both U.S. and EC law as medical devices. \\n(b) Additional products and proce-\\ndures may be made subject to this sub-part by agreement of the parties. \\n§ 26.34 Regulatory authorities. \\nThe regulatory authorities shall have \\nthe responsibility of implementing the provisions of this subpart, including the designation and monitoring of con-formity assessment bodies (CAB’s). Regulatory authorities will be speci-fied in appendix C of this subpart. Each party will promptly notify the other party in writing of any change in the regulatory authority for a country. \\n§ 26.35 Length and purpose of transi-\\ntion period. \\nThere will be a 3-year transition pe-\\nriod immediately following the date described in §26.80(a). During the tran-\\nsition period, the parties will engage in confidence-building activities for the purpose of obtaining sufficient evi-dence to make determinations con-cerning the equivalence of conformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) of the other party with respect to the ability to perform quality system and product evaluations or other reviews resulting in reports to be exchanged under this subpart. \\n§ 26.36 Listing of CAB’s. \\nEach party shall designate con-\\nformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) to participate in confidence building ac-tivities by transmitting to the other party a list of CAB’s which meet the criteria for technical competence and independence, as identified in appendix A of this subpart. The list shall be ac-companied by supporting evidence. Designated CAB’s will be listed in ap-pendix D of this subpart for participa-tion in the confidence building activi-ties once confirmed by the importing party. Nonconfirmation would have to be justified based on documented evi-dence. \\n§ 26.37 Confidence building activities. \\n(a) At the beginning of the transi-\\ntional period, the Joint Sectoral Group will establish a joint confidence build-ing program calculated to provide suf-ficient evidence of the capabilities of the designated conformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) to perform quality sys-tem or product evaluations to the spec-ifications of the parties. \\n(b) The joint confidence building pro-\\ngram should include the following ac-tions and activities: \\n(1) Seminars designed to inform the \\nparties and CAB’s about each party’s regulatory system, procedures, and re-quirements; \\n(2) Workshops designed to provide the \\nparties with information regarding re-quirements and procedures for the des-ignation and surveillance of CAB’s; \\n(3) Exchange of information about re-\\nports prepared during the transition period; \\n(4) Joint training exercises; and \\n(5) Observed inspections.

The form and con-tent of the reports will be determined by the parties through the Joint Sec-toral Committee. \\n§ 26.38 Other transition period activi-\\nties. \\n(a) During the transition period, the \\nparties will jointly determine the nec-essary information which must be present in quality system and product evaluation reports. \\n(b) The parties will jointly develop a \\nnotification and alert system to be used in case of defects, recalls, and other problems concerning product quality that could necessitate addi-tional actions (e.g., inspections by the parties of the importing country) or suspension of the distribution of the product. \\n§ 26.39 Equivalence assessment. \\n(a) In the final 6 months of the tran-\\nsition period, the parties shall proceed to a joint assessment of the equiva-lence of the conformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) that participated in the confidence building activities. CAB’s will be determined to be equivalent provided they have demonstrated pro-ficiency through the submission of a sufficient number of adequate reports. CAB’s may be determined to be equiva-lent with regard to the ability to per-form any type of quality system or product evaluation covered by this sub-part and with regard to any type of product covered by this subpart. The parties shall develop a list contained in appendix E of this subpart of CAB’s de-termined to be equivalent, which shall contain a full explanation of the scope of the equivalency determination, in-cluding any appropriate limitations, with regard to performing any type of \\nquality system or product evaluation. \\n(b) The parties shall allow CAB’s not \\nlisted for participation in this subpart, or listed for participation only as to certain types of evaluations, to apply for participation in this subpart once the necessary measures have been taken or sufficient experience has been gained, in accordance with §26.46. \\n(c) Decisions concerning the equiva-\\nlence of CAB’s must be agreed to by both parties. \\n§ 26.40 Start of the operational period. \\n(a) The operational period will start \\nat the end of the transition period after the parties have developed the list of conformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) found to be equivalent. The provisions of §§26.40, 26.41, 26.42, 26.43, 26.44, 26.45, and 26.46 will apply only with regard to listed CAB’s and only to the extent of any specifications and limitations con-tained on the list with regard to a CAB. \\n(b) The operational period will apply \\nto quality system evaluation reports and product evaluation reports gen-erated by CAB’s listed in accordance with this subpart for the evaluations performed in the respective territories of the parties, except if the parties agree otherwise. \\n§ 26.41 Exchange and endorsement of \\nquality system evaluation reports. \\n(a) Listed European Community (EC) \\nconformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) will provide FDA with reports of qual-ity system evaluations, as follows: \\n(1) For preapproval quality system \\nevaluations, EC CAB’s will provide full reports; and \\n(2) For surveillance quality system \\nevaluations, EC CAB’s will provide ab-breviated reports. \\n(b) Listed U.S. CAB’s will provide to \\nthe EC Notified Body of the manufac-turer’s choice: \\n(1) Full reports of initial quality sys-\\ntem evaluations; \\n(2) Abbreviated reports of quality \\nsystems surveillance audits. \\n(c) If the abbreviated reports do not \\nprovide sufficient information, the im-porting party may request additional clarification from the CAB. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00382 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '372', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Examples of such circumstances in-clude indications of material inconsist-encies or inadequacies in a report, quality defects identified in postmarket surveillance or other spe-cific evidence of serious concern in re-lation to product quality or consumer safety. In such cases, the importing party may request clarification from the exporting party which may lead to a request for reinspection. The parties will endeavor to respond to requests for clarification in a timely manner. Where divergence is not clarified in this process, the importing party may carry out the quality system evalua-tion. \\n§ 26.42 Exchange and endorsement of \\nproduct evaluation reports. \\n(a) European Community (EC) con-\\nformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) list-ed for this purpose will, subject to the specifications and limitations on the list, provide to FDA 510(k) premarket notification assessment reports pre-pared to U.S. medical device require-ments. \\n(b) U.S. CAB’s will, subject to the \\nspecifications and limitations on the list, provide to the EC Notified Body of the manufacturer’s choice, type exam-ination, and verification reports pre-pared to EC medical device require-ments. \\n(c) Based on the determination of \\nequivalence in light of the experience gained, the product evaluation reports prepared by the CAB’s listed as equiva-lent will normally be endorsed by the importing party, except under specific and delineated circumstances. Exam-ples of such circumstances include in-dications of material inconsistencies, inadequacies, or incompleteness in a product evaluation report, or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product safety, perform-ance, or quality. In such cases, the im-porting party may request clarification from the exporting party which may lead to a request for a reevaluation. The parties will endeavor to respond to \\nrequests for clarification in a timely manner. Endorsement remains the re-sponsibility of the importing party. \\n§ 26.43 Transmission of quality system \\nevaluation reports. \\nQuality system evaluation reports \\ncovered by §26.41 concerning products covered by this subpart shall be trans-mitted to the importing party within 60-calendar days of a request by the im-porting party. Should a new inspection be requested, the time period shall be extended by an additional 30-calendar days. A party may request a new in-spection, for cause, identified to the other party. If the exporting party can-not perform an inspection within a specified period of time, the importing party may perform an inspection on its own. \\n§ 26.44 Transmission of product eval-\\nuation reports. \\nTransmission of product evaluation \\nreports will take place according to the importing party’s specified procedures. \\n§ 26.45 Monitoring continued equiva-\\nlence. \\nMonitoring activities will be carried \\nout in accordance with §26.69. \\n§ 26.46 Listing of additional CAB’s. \\n(a) During the operational period, ad-\\nditional conformity assessment bodies (CAB’s) will be considered for equiva-lence using the procedures and criteria described in §§26.36, 26.37, and 26.39, taking into account the level of con-fidence gained in the overall regu-latory system of the other party. \\n(b) Once a designating authority con-\\nsiders that such CAB’s, having under-gone the procedures of §§26.36, 26.37, and 26.39, may be determined to be equivalent, it will then designate those bodies on an annual basis. Such proce-dures satisfy the procedures of §26.66(a) and (b). \\n(c) Following such annual designa-\\ntions, the procedures for confirmation of CAB’s under §26.66(c) and (d) shall apply. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00383 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '373', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

In this instance, the Joint Committee may decide that the body concerned be verified. After the completion of such verification, the proposal to list the CAB in subpart B may be resubmitted to the other party. \\n§ 26.67 Suspension of listed conformity \\nassessment bodies. \\nThe following procedures shall apply \\nwith regard to the suspension of a con-formity assessment body (CAB) listed in subpart B of this part. (a) A party shall notify the other \\nparty of its contestation of the tech-nical competence or compliance of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part and the contesting party’s intent to suspend such CAB.

      "page_content='405 Food and Drug Administration, HHS § 54.2 \\n§ 54.1 Purpose. \\n(a) The Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion (FDA) evaluates clinical studies submitted in marketing applications, required by law, for new human drugs and biological products and marketing applications and reclassification peti-tions for medical devices. \\n(b) The agency reviews data gen-\\nerated in these clinical studies to de-termine whether the applications are approvable under the statutory re-quirements. FDA may consider clinical studies inadequate and the data inad-equate if, among other things, appro-priate steps have not been taken in the design, conduct, reporting, and anal-ysis of the studies to minimize bias. One potential source of bias in clinical studies is a financial interest of the clinical investigator in the outcome of the study because of the way payment is arranged (e.g., a royalty) or because the investigator has a proprietary in-terest in the product (e.g., a patent) or because the investigator has an equity interest in the sponsor of the covered study. This section and conforming regulations require an applicant whose submission relies in part on clinical data to disclose certain financial ar-rangements between sponsor(s) of the covered studies and the clinical inves-tigators and certain interests of the clinical investigators in the product under study or in the sponsor of the covered studies. FDA will use this in-formation, in conjunction with infor-mation about the design and purpose of the study, as well as information ob-tained through on-site inspections, in \\nthe agency’s assessment of the reli-ability of the data. \\n§ 54.2 Definitions. \\nFor the purposes of this part: \\n(a) Compensation affected by the out-\\ncome of clinical studies means compensa-\\ntion that could be higher for a favor-able outcome than for an unfavorable outcome, such as compensation that is explicitly greater for a favorable result or compensation to the investigator in the form of an equity interest in the sponsor of a covered study or in the form of compensation tied to sales of the product, such as a royalty interest. \\n(b) Significant equity interest in the \\nsponsor of a covered study means any ownership interest, stock options, or \\nother financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices (generally, interests in a nonpublicly traded cor-poration), or any equity interest in a \\npublicly traded corporation that ex-ceeds $50,000 during the time the clin-ical investigator is carrying out the study and for 1 year following comple-tion of the study. \\n(c) Proprietary interest in the tested \\nproduct means property or other finan-\\ncial interest in the product including, but not limited to, a patent, trade-mark, copyright or licensing agree-ment. \\n(d) Clinical investigator means only a \\nlisted or identified investigator or sub-investigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of re-search subjects. The term also includes the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator. \\n(e) Covered clinical study means any \\nstudy of a drug or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA re-lies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or any study in which a single investi-gator makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety. This would, in general, not include phase l tolerance studies or pharmacokinetic studies, most clinical pharmacology studies (unless they are critical to an efficacy determination), large open safety studies conducted at multiple sites, treatment protocols, and parallel track protocols. An applicant may con-sult with FDA as to which clinical studies constitute ‘‘covered clinical studies’’ for purposes of complying with financial disclosure requirements. \\n(f) Significant payments of other sorts \\nmeans payments made by the sponsor of a covered study to the investigator or the institution to support activities of the investigator that have a mone-tary value of more than $25,000, exclu-sive of the costs of conducting the clin-ical study or other clinical studies, (e.g., a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment or retainers for ongoing consultation \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00415 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '405', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The applicant is re-sponsible for submitting the appro-priate certification and disclosure statements required in this part. \\n(h) Sponsor of the covered clinical study \\nmeans the party supporting a par-ticular study at the time it was carried out. \\n[63 FR 5250, Feb. 2, 1998, as amended at 63 FR \\n72181, Dec. 31, 1998] \\n§ 54.3 Scope. \\nThe requirements in this part apply \\nto any applicant who submits a mar-keting application for a human drug, biological product, or device and who submits covered clinical studies. The applicant is responsible for making the appropriate certification or disclosure statement where the applicant either contracted with one or more clinical investigators to conduct the studies or submitted studies conducted by others not under contract to the applicant. \\n§ 54.4 Certification and disclosure re-\\nquirements. \\nFor purposes of this part, an appli-\\ncant must submit a list of all clinical \\ninvestigators who conducted covered clinical studies to determine whether the applicant’s product meets FDA’s marketing requirements, identifying those clinical investigators who are full-time or part-time employees of the sponsor of each covered study. The ap-plicant must also completely and accu-rately disclose or certify information concerning the financial interests of a clinical investigator who is not a full- time or part-time employee of the sponsor for each covered clinical study. Clinical investigators subject to inves-tigational new drug or investigational device exemption regulations must provide the sponsor of the study with sufficient accurate information needed to allow subsequent disclosure or cer-tification. The applicant is required to submit for each clinical investigator who participates in a covered study, ei-ther a certification that none of the fi-nancial arrangements described in §54.2 \\nexist, or disclose the nature of those arrangements to the agency. Where the applicant acts with due diligence to ob-tain the information required in this section but is unable to do so, the ap-plicant shall certify that despite the applicant’s due diligence in attempting to obtain the information, the appli-cant was unable to obtain the informa-tion and shall include the reason. \\n(a) The applicant (of an application \\nsubmitted under sections 505, 506, 510(k), 513, or 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) that relies in whole or in part on clinical studies shall submit, for each clinical investigator who participated in a cov-ered clinical study, either a certifi-cation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a disclosure statement described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. \\n(1) Certification: The applicant cov-\\nered by this section shall submit for all clinical investigators (as defined in §54.2(d)), to whom the certification ap-plies, a completed Form FDA 3454 at-testing to the absence of financial in-terests and arrangements described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The form shall be dated and signed by the chief financial officer or other respon-sible corporate official or representa-tive. \\n(2) If the certification covers less \\nthan all covered clinical data in the ap-plication, the applicant shall include in the certification a list of the studies covered by this certification. \\n(3) Disclosure Statement: For any \\nclinical investigator defined in §54.2(d) for whom the applicant does not sub-mit the certification described in para-graph (a)(1) of this section, the appli-cant shall submit a completed Form FDA 3455 disclosing completely and ac-curately the following: \\n(i) Any financial arrangement en-\\ntered into between the sponsor of the covered study and the clinical investi-gator involved in the conduct of a cov-ered clinical trial, whereby the value of the compensation to the clinical inves-tigator for conducting the study could \\nbe influenced by the outcome of the study; \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00416 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '406', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The investigator shall promptly update this information if any relevant changes occur in the course of the in-vestigation or for 1 year following com-pletion of the study. \\n(c) Refusal to file application. FDA \\nmay refuse to file any marketing appli-cation described in paragraph (a) of this section that does not contain the information required by this section or a certification by the applicant that the applicant has acted with due dili-gence to obtain the information but was unable to do so and stating the reason. \\n[63 FR 5250, Feb. 2, 1998; 63 FR 35134, June 29, \\n1998, as amended at 64 FR 399, Jan. 5, 1999] \\n§ 54.5 Agency evaluation of financial \\ninterests. \\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure statement. \\nFDA will evaluate the information dis-closed under §54.4(a)(2) about each cov-ered clinical study in an application to determine the impact of any disclosed financial interests on the reliability of the study. FDA may consider both the size and nature of a disclosed financial interest (including the potential in-crease in the value of the interest if the product is approved) and steps that have been taken to minimize the po-tential for bias. \\n(b) Effect of study design. In assessing \\nthe potential of an investigator’s finan-cial interests to bias a study, FDA will \\ntake into account the design and pur-pose of the study. Study designs that utilize such approaches as multiple in-vestigators (most of whom do not have a disclosable interest), blinding, objec-tive endpoints, or measurement of endpoints by someone other than the investigator may adequately protect against any bias created by a disclosable financial interest. \\n(c) Agency actions to ensure reliability \\nof data. If FDA determines that the fi-\\nnancial interests of any clinical inves-tigator raise a serious question about the integrity of the data, FDA will take any action it deems necessary to ensure the reliability of the data in-\\ncluding: \\n(1) Initiating agency audits of the \\ndata derived from the clinical investi-gator in question; \\n(2) Requesting that the applicant \\nsubmit further analyses of data, e.g., to evaluate the effect of the clinical in-vestigator’s data on overall study out-come; \\n(3) Requesting that the applicant \\nconduct additional independent studies to confirm the results of the ques-tioned study; and \\n(4) Refusing to treat the covered clin-\\nical study as providing data that can be the basis for an agency action. \\n§ 54.6 Recordkeeping and record re-\\ntention. \\n(a) Financial records of clinical inves-\\ntigators to be retained.

The term does not include experiments that must meet the provisions of part 58, re-garding nonclinical laboratory studies. The terms research, clinical research, \\nclinical study, study, and clinical inves-\\ntigation are deemed to be synonymous \\nfor purposes of this part. \\n(d) Emergency use means the use of a \\ntest article on a human subject in a life-threatening situation in which no standard acceptable treatment is avail-able, and in which there is not suffi-cient time to obtain IRB approval. \\n(e) Human subject means an indi-\\nvidual who is or becomes a participant in research, either as a recipient of the test article or as a control. A subject may be either a healthy individual or a patient. \\n(f) Institution means any public or \\nprivate entity or agency (including Federal, State, and other agencies). The term facility as used in section \\n520(g) of the act is deemed to be syn-onymous with the term institution for \\npurposes of this part. \\n(g) Institutional Review Board (IRB) \\nmeans any board, committee, or other group formally designated by an insti-tution to review, to approve the initi-ation of, and to conduct periodic re-view of, biomedical research involving human subjects.

In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies that subjects would receive even if not par-ticipating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsi-bility. \\n(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. \\nIn making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research in-volving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, handicapped, or mentally disabled per-sons, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons. \\n(4) Informed consent will be sought \\nfrom each prospective subject or the subject’s legally authorized representa-tive, in accordance with and to the ex-tent required by part 50. \\n(5) Informed consent will be appro-\\npriately documented, in accordance with and to the extent required by §50.27.

If it is determined that a study was or would be essential, the Food and Drug Administration shall also determine whether the study is acceptable, notwithstanding the dis-qualification of the facility. Any study done by a testing facility before or after disqualification may be presumed to be unacceptable, and the person re-lying on the study may be required to establish that the study was not af-fected by the circumstances that led to the disqualification, e.g., by submit-ting validating information. If the study is then determined to be unac-ceptable, such data will be eliminated from consideration in support of the application; and such elimination may serve as new information justifying the termination or withdrawal of approval \\nof the application. \\n(b) No nonclinical laboratory study \\nbegun by a testing facility after the date of the facility’s disqualification shall be considered in support of any application for a research or marketing permit, unless the facility has been re-instated under §58.219. The determina-tion that a study may not be consid-ered in support of an application for a research or marketing permit does not, however, relieve the applicant for such a permit of any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the results of the study to the Food and Drug Administration. \\n[43 FR 60013, Dec. 22, 1978, as amended at 59 \\nFR 13200, Mar. 21, 1994] \\n§ 58.213 Public disclosure of informa-\\ntion regarding disqualification. \\n(a) Upon issuance of a final order dis-\\nqualifying a testing facility under §58.206(a), the Commissioner may no-tify all or any interested persons. Such notice may be given at the discretion of the Commissioner whenever he be-lieves that such disclosure would fur-\\nther the public interest or would pro-mote compliance with the good labora-tory practice regulations set forth in this part. Such notice, if given, shall include a copy of the final order issued under §58.206(a) and shall state that the disqualification constitutes a deter-mination by the Food and Drug Admin-istration that nonclinical laboratory studies performed by the facility will not be considered by the Food and Drug Administration in support of any application for a research or marketing \\npermit. If such notice is sent to an-other Federal Government agency, the Food and Drug Administration will recommend that the agency also con-sider whether or not it should accept nonclinical laboratory studies per-formed by the testing facility. If such notice is sent to any other person, it shall state that it is given because of the relationship between the testing fa-cility and the person being notified and that the Food and Drug Administra-tion is not advising or recommending that any action be taken by the person notified. \\n(b) A determination that a testing fa-\\ncility has been disqualified and the ad-ministrative record regarding such de-termination are disclosable to the pub-lic under part 20 of this chapter. \\n§ 58.215 Alternative or additional ac-\\ntions to disqualification. \\n(a) Disqualification of a testing facil-\\nity under this subpart is independent of, and neither in lieu of nor a pre-condition to, other proceedings or ac-tions authorized by the act. The Food and Drug Administration may, at any time, institute against a testing facil-ity and/or against the sponsor of a non-clinical laboratory study that has been submitted to the Food and Drug Ad-ministration any appropriate judicial proceedings (civil or criminal) and any other appropriate regulatory action, in addition to or in lieu of, and prior to, simultaneously with, or subsequent to, disqualification. The Food and Drug Administration may also refer the matter to another Federal, State, or local government law enforcement or regulatory agency for such action as that agency deems appropriate. \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00440 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '430', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

Substances capable of imparting a color to a container for foods, drugs, or cosmetics are not color additives un-less the customary or reasonably fore-\\nseeable handling or use of the con-tainer may reasonably be expected to result in the transmittal of the color to the contents of the package or any part thereof. Food ingredients such as cher-ries, green or red peppers, chocolate, and orange juice which contribute their own natural color when mixed with other foods are not regarded as color additives ; but where a food sub-\\nstance such as beet juice is delib-erately used as a color, as in pink lem-onade, it is a color additive. Food ingre-\\ndients as authorized by a definitions and standard of identity prescribed by regulations pursuant to section 401 of the act are color additives, where the in-\\ngredients are specifically designated in the definitions and standards of iden-tity as permitted for use for coloring purposes. An ingredient of an animal feed whose intended function is to im-part, through the biological processes of the animal, a color to the meat, milk, or eggs of the animal is a color additive and is not exempt from the re-quirements of the statute. This defini-tion shall apply whether or not such ingredient has nutritive or other func-tions in addition to the property of im-parting color. An ingested drug the in-tended function of which is to impart color to the human body is a color addi-\\ntive. For the purposes of this part, the \\nterm color includes black, white, and \\nintermediate grays, but substances in-cluding migrants from packaging ma-terials which do not contribute any color apparent to the naked eye are not color additives. \\n(g) For a material otherwise meeting \\nthe definition of color additive to be ex-\\nempt from section 721 of the act, on the basis that it is used (or intended to be used) solely for a purpose or purposes other than coloring, the material must be used in a way that any color im-parted is clearly unimportant insofar as the appearance, value, market-ability, or consumer acceptability is concerned.

If the pesticide chemical, soil or plant nutri-ent, or other agricultural chemical itself acts as a color or carries as an in-gredient a color, and because of this property colors the produce of the soil, it is a color additive and is not exempt. \\n(i) Safe means that there is con-\\nvincing evidence that establishes with reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of the color additive. \\n(j) The term straight color means a \\ncolor additive listed in parts 73, 74, and 81 of this chapter, and includes lakes and such substances as are permitted by the specifications for such color. \\n(k) The term mixture means a color \\nadditive made by mixing two or more straight colors, or one or more straight colors and one or more diluents. \\n(l) The term lake means a straight \\ncolor extended on a substratum by ad-sorption, coprecipitation, or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made by simple mixing process. \\n(m) The term diluent means any com-\\nponent of a color additive mixture that is not of itself a color additive and has been intentionally mixed therein to fa-cilitate the use of the mixture in color-ing foods, drugs, or cosmetics or in coloring the human body. The diluent may serve another functional purpose in the foods, drugs, or cosmetics, as for example sweetening, flavoring, emulsifying, or stabilizing, or may be a functional component of an article in-tended for coloring the human body. \\n(n) The term substratum means the \\nsubstance on which the pure color in a lake is extended. \\n(o) The term pure color means the \\ncolor contained in a color additive, ex-clusive of any intermediate or other component, or of any diluent or sub-stratum contained therein. \\n(p) The term batch means a homo-\\ngeneous lot of color additive or color additive mixture produced by an iden-tified production operation, which is set apart and held as a unit for the pur-pose of obtaining certification of such \\nquantity. \\n(q) The term batch number means the \\nnumber assigned to a batch by the per-son who requests certification thereof. \\n(r) The term lot number means an \\nidentifying number or symbol assigned to a batch by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration. \\n(s) The term area of the eye means the \\narea enclosed with in the circum-ference of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids and the eyelashes, and con-junctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter of the infra-or-bital ridge. \\n(t) The term package means the im-\\nmediate container in which a color ad-ditive or color additive mixture has been packed for shipment or delivery. If the package is then packed in a ship-ping carton or other protective con-tainer, such container shall not be con-sidered to be the immediate container. In the case of color additive mixtures for household use containing less than 15 percent pure color, when two or more containers of 3 ounces each or less, each containing a different color, are distributed as a unit, the imme-diate container for such unit shall be considered to be the package as defined in this section. \\n(u) The hair dye exemption in section \\n601(a) of the act applies to coal tar hair dyes intended for use in altering the color of the hair and which are, or which bear or contain, color additives derived from coal tar with the sen-sitization potential of causing skin ir-ritation in certain individuals and pos-\\nsible blindness when used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows. The exemp-tion is permitted with the condition that the label of any such article bear conspicuously the statutory caution and adequate directions for prelimi-nary patch-testing.

In addition to \\nall other information required by the act, labels for color additives, except those in a form suitable for coloring the human body, shall state: \\n(1) The name of the straight color or \\nthe name of each ingredient com-prising the color additive, if it is a mixture. \\n(2) A statement indicating general \\nlimitations for the use of the color ad-ditive, such as ‘‘for food use only’’; ‘‘for food, drug, and cosmetic use’’; ‘‘for use in drugs for external application only.’’ \\n(3) Where regulations issued impose \\nquantitative limitations for a general or specific use of a straight color, the amount of each such straight color in terms of weight per unit/volume or per-cent by weight. \\n(4) An expiration date if stability \\ndata require it. \\n(b) Special labeling for color additives \\nwith tolerances. Where tolerances are \\nimposed for a general or specific use of a color additive, the label shall in addi-tion provide directions for use of the color additive which if followed will preclude the food, drug, or cosmetic to which it is added from containing an amount of the color additive in excess of the tolerance. \\n(c) Special labeling for color additives \\nwith other limitations. If use of the color \\nadditive is subject to other limitations prescribed in this part, such limita-tions shall be stated on the label of the color additive by a plain and con-spicuous statement. Examples of such limitation statements are: ‘‘Do not use in products used in the area of the \\neye’’; ‘‘Do not use for coloring drugs for injection.’’ \\n(d) Special labeling for color additives \\nnot exempt from certification. Color addi-\\ntives not exempt from the certification procedures shall in addition include in the labeling the lot number assigned by the Color Certification Branch, except that in the case of any mixture for household use which contains not more than 15 percent of pure color and which is in packages containing not more than 3 ounces there appears on the label, a code number which the manu-facturer has identified with the lot number by giving to the Food and Drug Administration written notice that such code number will be used in lieu \\nof the lot number. \\nSubpart C—Safety Evaluation \\n§ 70.40 Safety factors to be considered. \\nIn accordance with section \\n721(b)(5)(A)(iii) of the act, the following safety factor will be applied in deter-mining whether the proposed use of a color additive will be safe: Except where evidence is submitted which jus-tifies use of a different safety factor, a safety factor of 100 to 1 will be used in applying animal experimentation data to man; that is, a color additive for use by man will not be granted a tolerance that will exceed 1/100th of the max-imum no-effect level for the most sus-ceptible experimental animals tested. The various species of experimental animals used in the tests shall conform to good pharmacological practice. \\n§ 70.42 Criteria for evaluating the safe-\\nty of color additives. \\n(a) In deciding whether a petition is \\ncomplete and suitable for filing and in reaching a decision on any petition filed, the Commissioner will apply the ‘‘safe-for-use’’ principle. This will re-quire the presentation of all needed scientific data in support of a proposed listing to assure that each listed color additive will be safe for its intended use or uses in or on food, drugs, or cos-metics. The Commissioner may list a color additive for use generally in or on food, in or on drugs, or in or on cos-metics when he finds from the data presented that such additive is suitable and may safely be employed for such general use; he may list an additive only for more limited use or uses for which it is proven suitable and may safely be employed; and he is author-ized to prescribe broadly the conditions under which the additive may be safely employed for such use or uses. This may allow the use of a particular dye, pigment, or other substance with cer-tain diluents, but not with others, or at a higher concentration with some than with others. \\n(b) The safety for external color addi-\\ntives will normally be determined by tests for acute oral toxicity, primary irritation, sensitization, subacute der-mal toxicity on intact and abraded \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 10:27 Aug 01, 2022 Jkt 256071 PO 00000 Frm 00454 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\21\\\\21V1.TXT PC31kpayne on VMOFRWIN702 with $$_JOB' metadata={'source': 'CFR-2022-title21-vol1-chapI.pdf', 'page': '444', 'website_url': '/'}\n",

The Commissioner may waive any of such tests if data before him otherwise establish that such test is not required to determine safety for the use proposed. \\n(c) Upon written request describing \\nthe proposed use of a color additive and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the Commissioner will ad-vise a person who wishes to establish the safety of a color additive whether he believes the experiments planned will yield data adequate for an evalua-tion of the safety of the additive. \\n§ 70.45 Allocation of color additives. \\nWhenever, in the consideration of a \\npetition or a proposal to list a color ad-ditive or to alter an existing listing, the data before the Commissioner fail to show that it would be safe to list the color additive for all the uses proposed or at the levels proposed, the Commis-sioner will notify the petitioner and other interested persons by publication in the F\\nEDERAL REGISTER that it is nec-\\nessary to allocate the safe tolerance for the straight color in the color additive among the competing needs. This no-tice shall call for the presentation of data by all interested persons on which the allocation can be made in accord-ance with section 721(b)(8) of the act. The time for acting upon the petition shall be stayed until such data are pre-sented, whereupon the time limits shall begin to run anew. As promptly as possible after presentation of the data, the Commissioner will, by order, announce the allocation and the toler-ance limitations. \\n§ 70.50 Application of the cancer \\nclause of section 721 of the act. \\n(a) Color additives that may be ingested. \\nWhenever (1) the scientific data before the Commissioner (either the reports from the scientific literature or the re-sults of biological testing) suggest the possibility that the color additive in-cluding its components or impurities has induced cancer when ingested by man or animal; or (2) tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of additives in food suggest that the color additive, including its compo-nents or impurities, induces cancer in man or animal, the Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judg-\\nment of appropriately qualified sci-entists, cancer has been induced and whether the color additive, including its components or impurities, was the causative substance. If it is his judg-ment that the data do not establish these facts, the cancer clause is not ap-plicable; and if the data considered as a whole establish that the color additive will be safe under the conditions that can be specified in the applicable regu-lation, it may be listed for such use. But if in the judgment of the Commis-sioner, based on information from qualified scientists, cancer has been in-duced, no regulation may issue which permits its use. \\n(b) Color additives that will not be in-\\ngested. Whenever the scientific data be-\\nfore the Commissioner suggest the pos-\\nsibility that the color additive, includ-ing its components or impurities, has induced cancer in man or animals by routes other than ingestion, the Com-missioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of appropriately qualified scientists, the test suggesting the possibility of carcinogenesis is ap-propriate for the evaluation of the color additive for a use which does not involve ingestion, cancer has been in-duced, and the color additive, including its components or impurities, was the causative substance. If it is his judg-ment that the data do not establish these facts, the cancer clause is not ap-plicable to preclude external drug and cosmetic uses, and if the data as a whole establish that the color additive will be safe under conditions that can be specified in the regulations, it may be listed for such use. But if, in the judgment of the Commissioner, based on information from qualified sci-entists, the test is an appropriate one for the consideration of safety for the proposed external use, and cancer has been induced by the color additive, in-cluding its components or impurities, no regulation may issue which permits its use in external drugs and cosmetics. \\n(c) Color additives for use as an ingre-\\ndient of feed for animals that are raised for food production.

None of the controls that have died have shown liver damage. \\n(2) Groups of 100 mice are being fed \\ndiets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0.1 percent FD&C Red No. 1, with 400 mice as controls. All mice on dosage levels of 2 percent and 1 percent died before the seventieth week. Gross liver damage has been ob-served in all groups fed at the 0.5 per-cent diet and above. \\n(3) Groups of 4 dogs are being fed \\ndiets containing 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.25 percent, and 0 percent FD&C Red No. 1. Three of the dogs on the 2 per-cent dosage level died before 32 weeks; the other is living. Three of the dogs on the 1 percent dosage level died or were sacrificed within 13 months. All de-ceased or sacrificed dogs have shown liver damage grossly and/or micro-scopically. Deceased dogs on the 1 per-cent and 2 percent dosage level showed poor physical condition. \\nThe Commissioner of Food and Drugs \\nhaving concluded that ingestion of this color additive over a long period of time would be unsafe, and in order to protect the public health, hereby ter-minates the provisional listing of FD&C Red No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. \\n(d) FD&C Red No. 4. Feeding tests of \\nthis color additive have been conducted with three species: \\n(1) Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and \\nSprague-Dawley strains were fed FD&C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 per-cent, 2 percent, 1 percent, and 0.5 per-cent of the diet. No effect was found. \\n(2) Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL \\nstrains were fed FD&C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 2 percent and 1 per-cent of the diet. No effect was found. \\n(3) Dogs were fed FD&C Red No. 4 at \\nlevels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2-percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5\\n1⁄2years on the test. Two \\nof the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the \\n7 year study. \\nThe Commissioner of Food and Drugs \\nhas concluded that available data do not permit the establishment of a safe level of use of this color additive in food, ingested drugs and ingested cos-metics. In order to protect the public health, the Commissioner hereby ter-minates the provisional listing of FD&C Red No. 4 for use in food and in-gested drugs. The Commissioner has \\npreviously terminated the provisional listing of FD&C Red No. 4 for use in in-gested cosmetics. FD&C Red No. 4 is listed for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics by §§74.1304 and 74.2304 of this chapter, respectively. Section 82.304 of this chapter is re-tained in part 82 of this chapter to per-mit the use of lakes of FD&C Red No. 4 in externally applied drugs and cos-metics. \\n(e) FD&C Violet No. 1. The Commis-\\nsioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby ter-minates the provisional listing of FD&C Violet No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. \\n(f) FD&C Red No. 2. The Commis-\\nsioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby ter-minates the provisional listing of FD&C Red No. 2 for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics. \\n(g) Carbon black (prepared by the ‘‘im-\\npingement’’ or ‘‘channel’’ process ). The \\nCommissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional list-ing of carbon black (prepared by the impingement or channel process) for use \\nin food, drugs, and cosmetics. \\n(h) D&C Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. \\nThe petition for these color additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their continued provi-sional listing.

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&C Red No. 10, D&C Red No. 11, D&C Red No. 12, and D&C Red No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective De-cember 13, 1977. \\n(i) Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1. The Com-\\nmissioner has learned of the contami-nation of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1 with 4- aminobiphenyl. The Commissioner con-cludes that this color cannot be pro-duced with any reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4- aminobiphenyl as an impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary reaction product that might be present in the color. 4- Aminobiphenyl and benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. In addition, insuffi-cient data have been submitted to per-mit establishment of appropriate speci-fications for the batch certification of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the pub-lic health, hereby terminates the provi-sional listing of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977. \\n(j) Graphite. Data have been devel-\\noped that show the contamination of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hy-drocarbons (PNA’s). There is no reason-able assurance this color can be pro-duced so that it will not contain PNA’s as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA’s in graphite would indicate that PNA’s known to be carcinogenic to ani-mals and humans may also be present. Therefore, there is no scientific evi-dence that will support a safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional list-ing of graphite for use in externally ap-plied cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977. \\n(k) Ext. D&C Green No. 1. The Com-\\nmissioner concludes that there are in-adequate analytical methods to permit certification of the color additive Ext. \\nD&C Green No. 1. In addition, the Com-missioner has found that there was a failure to comply with the conditions attached to the postponement of the closing date in accordance with section 203(a)(2) of the transitional provisions of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provi-sional listing of Ext. D&C Green No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977. \\n(l) [Reserved] (m) D&C Orange Nos. 10 and 11. In the \\nabsense of a petition to list D&C Or-ange No. 10 and D&C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provi-sional listing for such uses. Therefore, FDA is terminating the provisional listing of D&C Orange No. 10 and D&C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective April 28, 1981. \\n(n) D&C Blue No. 6. The Commis-\\nsioner of Food and Drugs, having con-cluded that unresolved questions re-main concerning the chemistry of un-identified minor components, hereby terminates the provisional listing of D&C Blue No. 6 for use in drugs and cosmetics. \\n(o) D&C Green No. 6. In the absence of \\na petition to list D&C Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provi-sional listing for such uses.

Within 60 days after \\nreceiving a submission under this part, FDA may: \\n(1) Determine that the manufacturer \\ndoes not comply with the requirements under this part and that, as a result, the manufacturer shall not disseminate any information under this part; \\n(2) After providing the manufacturer \\nnotice and an opportunity for a meet-ing, determine that the information submitted regarding a new use fails to provide data, analyses, or other writ-ten matter that is objective and bal-anced and: \\n(i) Require the manufacturer to dis-\\nseminate additional information, in-cluding information that the manufac-turer has submitted to FDA or, where appropriate, a summary of such infor-mation or any other information that can be made publicly available, which, in the agency’s opinion: \\n(A) Is objective and scientifically \\nsound; \\n(B) Pertains to the safety or effec-\\ntiveness of the new use; and \\n(C) Is necessary to provide objec-\\ntivity and balance; and (ii) Require the manufacturer to dis-\\nseminate an objective statement pre-pared by FDA that is based on data or other scientifically sound information available to the agency and bears on the safety or effectiveness of the drug or device for the new use; and \\n(3) Require the manufacturer to \\nmaintain records that will identify in-dividual recipients of the information that is to be disseminated when such individual records are warranted due to special safety considerations associ-ated with the new use. \\n(b) Protocols/Studies. Within 60 days \\nafter receiving a submission under this part, FDA shall: \\n(1) If the manufacturer has planned \\nstudies that will be needed for the sub-mission of a supplemental application for the new use, review the manufac-turer’s proposed protocols and schedule for completing such studies and deter-mine whether the proposed protocols are adequate and whether the proposed schedule for completing the studies is reasonable. FDA shall notify the manu-facturer of its determination; or \\n(2) If the manufacturer has completed \\nstudies that the manufacturer believes would be an adequate basis for the sub-mission of a supplemental application for the new use, conduct a review of the protocols submitted for such stud-ies to determine whether they are ade-quate.

FDA may grant or deny the request or, after con-sulting the manufacturer, grant an ex-tension different from that requested by the manufacturer. FDA may grant a manufacturer’s request for an exten-sion if FDA determines that the manu-facturer has acted with due diligence to conduct the studies needed for the submission of a supplemental applica-tion for a new use and to submit such a supplemental application to FDA in a timely manner and that, despite such actions, the manufacturer needs addi-tional time to complete the studies and submit the supplemental application. Extensions under this paragraph shall not exceed 24 months. \\n(c) If FDA extends the time period for \\ncompleting the studies and submitting a supplemental application under para-graph (a) of this section after the man-ufacturer has submitted a certification under §99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B), or if FDA grants a manufacturer’s request for an extension under paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer shall submit a new certification under §99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B) that sets forth the timeframe within which clinical stud-ies will be completed and a supple-mental application will be submitted to FDA. \\n§ 99.305 Exemption from the require-\\nment to file a supplemental applica-tion. \\n(a) Within 60 days after receipt of an \\napplication for an exemption from the requirement of a supplemental applica-tion, FDA shall approve or deny the ap-plication. \\n(1) If FDA does not act on the appli-\\ncation for an exemption within the 60- day period, the application for an ex-emption shall be deemed to be ap-proved. \\n(2) If an application for an exemption \\nis deemed to be approved, FDA may, at any time, terminate such approval if it determines that the requirements for granting an exemption have not been \\nmet. FDA shall notify the manufac-turer if the approval is terminated. \\n(b) In reviewing an application for an \\nexemption, FDA shall consider the ma-terials submitted by the manufacturer and may consider any other appro-priate information, including, but not limited to, any pending or previously approved applications for exemption submitted by the manufacturer. \\n(c) FDA may grant an application for \\nan exemption if FDA determines that: \\n(1) It would be economically prohibi-\\ntive for the manufacturer to incur the costs necessary to submit a supple-mental application for a new use, which at a minimum requires: \\n(i) That existing data characterizing \\nthe safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supple-mental application for the new use; and \\n(ii) That the cost of the study or \\nstudies for the new use reasonably ex-ceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the cost of goods sold and marketing and administrative ex-penses attributable to the new use of the product, and there are not less ex-pensive ways to obtain the needed in-formation; or \\n(2) It would be unethical to conduct \\nclinical studies needed to support the submission of a supplemental applica-tion for the new use because: \\n(i) Existing data characterizing the \\nsafety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be dis-seminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental ap-plication for the new use; and \\n(ii) Although available evidence \\nwould not support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the ex-tent that withholding the drug or de-vice in a controlled study would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects and no studies in different populations or of modified design can be utilized.

If FDA receives data after \\na manufacturer has begun dissemi-nating information on a new use and, based on that data, determines that the new use that is the subject of infor-mation disseminated under this part may not be effective or may present a significant risk to public health, FDA shall consult the manufacturer and, after such consultation, take appro-priate action to protect the public health. Such action may include order-ing the manufacturer to cease dissemi-nating information on the new use and to take appropriate corrective action. \\n(b) FDA actions based on information \\ndisseminated by a manufacturer. If FDA \\ndetermines that a manufacturer is dis-seminating information that does not comply with the requirements under this part, FDA may: \\n(1) Provide to the manufacturer an \\nopportunity to bring itself into compli-ance with the requirements under this part if the manufacturer’s noncompli-ance constitutes a minor violation of these requirements; or \\n(2) Order the manufacturer to cease \\ndissemination of information and to take corrective action. FDA shall issue such an order only after it has: \\n(i) Provided notice to the manufac-\\nturer regarding FDA’s intent to issue an order to cease dissemination; and \\n(ii) Provided to the manufacturer an \\nopportunity for a meeting. FDA need not provide an opportunity for a meet-ing if the manufacturer certified that it will submit a supplemental applica-tion for the new use within 6 months of the date that dissemination can begin and the noncompliance involves a fail-ure to submit such supplemental appli-cation. \\n(c) FDA actions based on a manufactur-\\ner’s supplemental application. FDA may \\norder a manufacturer to cease dissemi-nating information under this part and \\nto take corrective action if: \\n(1) In the case of a manufacturer that \\nhas submitted a supplemental applica-tion for the new use, FDA determines that the supplemental application does not contain adequate information for approval of the new use; \\n(2) In the case of a manufacturer that \\nhas certified that it will submit a sup-plemental application for the new use within 6 months, the manufacturer has not, within the 6-month period, sub-mitted a supplemental application for the new use; \\n(3) In the case of a manufacturer that \\nhas certified that it will submit a sup-plemental application for the new use within 36 months or within such time as FDA has determined to be appro-priate under §99.303(a) or (b), such man-ufacturer has not submitted the sup-plemental application within the cer-tified time, or FDA, after an informal hearing, has determined that the man-ufacturer is not acting with due dili-gence to initiate or complete the stud-ies necessary to support a supple-mental application for the new use; or \\n(4) In the case of a manufacturer that \\nhas certified that it will submit a sup-plemental application for the new use within 36 months or within such time as FDA has determined to be appro-priate under §99.303(a) or (b), the manu-facturer has discontinued or termi-nated the clinical studies that would be necessary to support a supplemental application for a new use. \\n(d) Effective date of orders to cease dis-\\nsemination. An order to cease dissemi-\\nnation of information shall be effective upon date of receipt by the manufac-turer, unless otherwise stated in such order. \\n(e) Cessation of dissemination by a non-\\ncomplying manufacturer. A manufac-\\nturer that begins to disseminate infor-mation in compliance with this part, but subsequently fails to comply with this part, shall immediately cease dis-seminating information under this part.

If FDA also issues an order to cease dissemination of information, the manufacturer shall comply with the order no later than 60 days after its receipt. \\n(d) FDA may, at any time, terminate \\nthe approval of an application for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application for a new use if, after consulting with the manu-facturer that was granted such exemp-tion, FDA determines that the manu-facturer no longer meets the require-ments for an exemption on the basis that it is economically prohibitive or unethical to conduct the studies need-ed to submit a supplemental applica-tion for the new use. \\n(e) If FDA terminates an approval of \\nan application for an exemption under paragraph (d) of this section, the man-ufacturer must, within 60 days of being \\nnotified by FDA that its exemption ap-proval has been terminated, file a sup-plemental application for the new use that is the subject of the information being disseminated under the exemp-tion, certify, under §99.201(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) that it will file a supplemental application for the new use, or cease disseminating the information on the new use. FDA may require a manufac-turer that ceases dissemination of in-formation on the new use to undertake corrective action. \\n§ 99.405 Applicability of labeling, adul-\\nteration, and misbranding author-ity. \\nThe dissemination of information re-\\nlating to a new use for a drug or device may constitute labeling, evidence of a new intended use, adulteration, or mis-branding of the drug or device if such dissemination fails to comply with sec-tion 551 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360aaa) and the requirements of this part. A manufacturer’s failure to exer-cise due diligence in submitting the clinical studies that are necessary for the approval of a new use that is the subject of information disseminated under this part or in beginning or com-pleting such clinical studies shall be deemed a failure to comply with sec-tion 551 of the act and the require-ments of this part. \\nSubpart F—Recordkeeping and \\nReports \\n§ 99.501 Recordkeeping and reports. \\n(a) A manufacturer disseminating in-\\nformation under this part shall: \\n(1) Maintain records sufficient to \\nallow the manufacturer to take correc-tive action as required by FDA.
